## Cost Protection Mechanisms

### 1. Rate Limiting
- Free: 10 queries/month
- Email-gated: 50 queries/month
- Premium: 1000 queries/month

### 2. Circuit Breaker
- Automatic API shutoff at $10/day (~$300/month)
- Soft alerts at $5/day (~$150/month)

### 3. Per-User Limits
- Email-gated: $2/month max per user
- Premium: $10/month max per user

### 4. Cost Monitoring

## Worst-Case Scenarios

| Scenario | Monthly Cost | Mitigation |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Normal operation** (100 users) | $8-20 | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| **Heavy usage** (1000 users) | $60-120 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor closely |
| **Single malicious user** (1000 queries/day) | $31.50 | üö® Rate limit blocks this |
| **Bot attack** (10k queries/day) | $315 | üö® Circuit breaker stops at $10/day |

**Key insight:** Rate limiting + circuit breaker prevents runaway costs even under attack.

## Implementation Priority

### Week 1: Critical
- [ ] Add JWT authentication
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add circuit breaker
- [ ] Create email collection form

### Week 2-3: Important
- [ ] Build login/request-access pages
- [ ] Set up cost monitoring
- [ ] Test with 10 beta users
- [ ] Monitor costs daily

### Month 2-3: Nice to Have
- [ ] User dashboard (usage stats)
- [ ] Automated email notifications
- [ ] Cost analytics dashboard

## Economics Summary

### Without Controls (Risk)
- Vulnerable to abuse
- Potential $300-3,000/month costs
- No revenue model

### With Email-Gated (Current Plan)
- Protected from abuse
- $8-20/month costs
- Community building phase
- Path to premium

### With Premium Tier (Future)
- $1,500-4,000/month revenue
- $20-50/month costs
- **95-98% profit margins**
- Sustainable business model
