## 🧪 2. Platform Identity – What We Are (and Are Not)

| | ✅ We Are | ❌ We Are Not |
|--|----------|-------------|
| 🧠 | A **platform** for ingesting, structuring, and surfacing supplement evidence | A supplement store |
| 📚 | An **unbiased evidence layer** that others can integrate into their products | A source of medical advice |
| 🛠️ | A **modular system** built for scalability, integrations, and future acquisition | A static content site |
| 🛍️ | A connector between scientific evidence and purchase pathways | A supplement manufacturer |

📣 **Tagline:**  
> "EvidentFit is a platform that connects supplement science to real-world decisions — transforming tens of thousands of studies into clear, unbiased recommendations."

---

## 📈 3. Long-Term Strategy

- 🟢 **Short-term:** Build traffic and trust through free, unbiased evidence content and affiliate product recommendations.  
- 🟡 **Medium-term:** Showcase EvidentFit as a modular platform that can integrate with tools like Examine+, healthcare apps, or digital health platforms.  
- 🔒 **Long-term:** License the ingestion and evidence engine or sell the platform and underlying IP.

---

## 🧱 4. Platform Architecture

A public-facing **"How It Works"** page should present EvidentFit as a modular platform built from five core layers:

### 🔬 Evidence Engine  
- Ingests 200,000+ scientific papers  
- Scores and ranks them by relevance and quality

### 📊 Structuring Layer  
- Curates ~30,000 PubMed studies  
- Extracts key findings and applies evidence grading (A–D)

### 🧠 Personalization Layer  
- Deterministic filters for conditions, age, and drug use  
- No runtime LLM cost required

### 💊 Recommendation Layer  
- Pre-banked supplement recommendations with **Good / Better / Best** product tiers  
- Built for scale and easy updating

### 🛍️ Commerce Layer  
- Connects recommendations to purchase pathways (affiliate links today, brand APIs or B2B endpoints tomorrow)

📌 *This modular architecture enables EvidentFit to integrate into other ecosystems — from consumer apps to clinical decision platforms.*

Include subtle messaging that signals EvidentFit is **meant to integrate or be acquired**:

- Add a **Platform Integration** page or footer line:  
  > "EvidentFit is designed as a modular platform that can integrate into third-party products, apps, and ecosystems. For partnership or integration inquiries, contact [email]."

- Callout near the methodology section:  
  > "The EvidentFit evidence engine can power third-party platforms — from supplement research sites to clinical decision tools."

- Keep the codebase and architecture modular: buyers value **systems** over **sites**.

## 🚀 12. Next Steps – 4 to 6 Week Execution Plan

The following plan translates the strategic blueprint into an actionable roadmap. It’s focused on delivering the MVP (supplement-focused platform + affiliate monetization) while setting the foundation for future features and acquisition-readiness.

---

### 🧠 Phase 1 – Finalize Banking Architecture (Weeks 1–2)

The **banking system** is the heart of the platform. It transforms raw paper summaries into actionable knowledge units that power all downstream features. Most of the core ingestion work is done — now we focus on making banking structured, queryable, and scalable.

#### ✅ Goals:
- Finalize **Tier 1 + Tier 2 banking** (paper-level reasoning + combined summary)  
- Introduce **Tier 3 deterministic banking** for condition/drug-specific adjustments  
- Create a schema that will support future cost optimization and personalization

#### 📋 Action Steps:

1. **Define and freeze the banking schema**  
   - Each banked record should include:  
     - Compound metadata (name, synonyms, forms)  
     - Outcome/goals addressed  
     - Evidence strength (A–D)  
     - Summary of combined reasoning (Tier 1 + 2)  
     - Deterministic adjustments for condition/drug/age  
     - References (PMIDs or DOIs)  
   - Store this as structured JSON to feed the front-end and future APIs.

2. **Refactor Tier 2 to combine reasoning + grading**  
   - Current Tier 2 may only summarize reasoning.  
   - Update it to **merge Tier 1 evidence** into a “combined synthesis” *and* assign final evidence grade (A–D).  
   - This ensures banked records are standalone and self-contained.

3. **Add Tier 3 deterministic layer**  
   - Instead of using LLM calls, implement condition/drug/age adjustments with simple rule-based logic.  
   - Example: If drug = SSRI → adjust ashwagandha recommendation → warning or downgrade.

4. **Bank the outputs to a queryable store**  
   - Save outputs as `banked_supplements.jsonl` or database entries.  
   - Include versioning and timestamping to allow future re-banking.

5. **Run initial test bank**  
   - Bank 10–15 core compounds (e.g., creatine, beta-alanine, omega-3, ashwagandha).  
   - Validate schema consistency, retrieval speed, and display integration.

---

### 🛠️ Phase 2 – Build “Good / Better / Best” Product Layer (Weeks 2–3)

Affiliate commerce relies on pre-banked product recommendations. This is a small but critical layer.

#### ✅ Goals:
- Link banked evidence to real-world product choices  
- Prepare affiliate linking system for launch and future expansion

#### 📋 Action Steps:

1. **Create product tier schema**  
   - Each compound → 3 pre-selected products:  
     - `good` (budget, solid quality)  
     - `better` (trusted brand, mid-tier)  
     - `best` (premium, clinical-grade)  
   - Include fields for: product name, ASIN, price, affiliate URL, and rationale.

2. **Populate for pilot compounds**  
   - Select 3–5 compounds and manually source Amazon links.  
   - Verify affiliate tag propagation and disclosure compliance.

3. **Design fallback logic**  
   - If a product is unavailable → auto-hide or redirect to Amazon search URL.

4. **Add affiliate disclosure site-wide**  
   - Footer + product pages: “We may earn a commission from purchases made through these links.”

---

### 🧪 Phase 3 – Front-End Build (Weeks 3–5)

Now that evidence and product data are banked, build the user-facing layer that turns the platform into a usable product.

#### ✅ Goals:
- Create a frictionless browsing and stack-building experience  
- Surface evidence clearly and transparently  
- Encourage affiliate click-throughs without adding friction

#### 📋 Action Steps:

1. **Homepage** – Implement hero section, CTA, and trust messaging.  
2. **Methodology Page** – Visualize the five-layer platform architecture.  
3. **Supplement Goal Pages** – Display compounds by outcome (e.g., muscle gain, endurance).  
4. **Stack Builder Page** – Allow users to:  
   - Select compounds  
   - Choose Good / Better / Best tiers  
   - See pricing and evidence grades  
   - Copy or click affiliate links  
5. **Affiliate Links** – Implement link tracking and ensure proper attribution.

📌 *Design principle:* 3 clicks or fewer from evidence → recommendation → cart.

---

### 🧪 Phase 4 – Optional Enhancements (Weeks 5–6+)

These features are not required for MVP launch but will significantly improve platform value and revenue potential.

#### 📋 Action Steps:

1. **Amazon Cart API Integration (Optional)**  
   - Generate “Add All to Cart” links dynamically.  
   - Requires Associates API approval (3+ qualifying sales).

2. **Device-Based Cost Optimizer (Optional)**  
   - Implement a small endpoint that builds cost-optimized stacks using banked data.  
   - Limit to ~3 uses per device/month to control costs.

3. **Platform Integration Page**  
   - Add page highlighting API potential and integration opportunities:  
     > “Interested in using the EvidentFit evidence engine in your platform? Contact us.”

### 🧭 Recommended Milestones

| Week | Focus | Key Outcomes |
|------|-------|---------------|
| 1–2 | Finalize banking schema & Tier 3 logic | Fully structured evidence bank |
| 2–3 | Build product tier database + affiliate links | First revenue-ready dataset |
| 3–5 | Front-end MVP build | Launch-ready site |
| 5–6 | Optional features + polish | Cart API, optimizer, integration messaging |

---

### 📌 Guiding Principles

- **Evidence first, always.** Every feature should reinforce EvidentFit as the most trusted and unbiased evidence platform.  
- **Affiliate is transitional.** It’s a revenue bridge, not the long-term business model.  
- **Platform, not website.** Every architectural decision should keep integration and acquisition potential in mind.  
- **Friction kills conversion.** Minimize steps between research and action.  
- **Modularity = value.** Keep ingestion, banking, and recommendation layers decoupled for easier future integration or sale.
