# How EvidentFit Works

## Our Promise: Evidence First, Always

EvidentFit is built on one simple principle: **every recommendation must link directly to peer-reviewed research**. No guessing, no marketing hype, no cherry-picked studies to support predetermined conclusions.

## Where Our Data Comes From

### PubMed / MEDLINE
We continuously analyze peer-reviewed research from PubMed, the U.S. National Library of Medicine's database of 35+ million biomedical studies.

**We focus on:**
- Human studies on resistance training supplements
- Outcomes that matter: strength, muscle growth, performance, recovery
- Published, peer-reviewed research from established journals

**We exclude:**
- Animal studies
- Industry marketing materials
- Non-peer-reviewed sources
- Environmental/pollution research (e.g., nitrogen dioxide studies)

**Current database:** ~8,000 carefully selected research papers, updated monthly.

## How We Select Research

Not all studies are created equal. We evaluate research using objective criteria:

### Study Design Quality
- **Meta-analyses & systematic reviews**: Highest priority‚Äîsynthesize multiple studies
- **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**: Gold standard for testing interventions
- **Crossover studies**: Strong within-subject designs
- **Observational studies**: Useful context, but lower priority

### Sample Size & Rigor
- Larger, well-designed studies carry more weight
- We prioritize double-blind, placebo-controlled research
- Recent studies get preference, but older seminal work is valued

### Balanced Coverage
We ensure our database isn't dominated by over-studied topics. This means:
- Coverage across multiple supplements (not just creatine)
- Diverse populations (trained athletes, beginners, older adults, etc.)
- Various training goals (strength, hypertrophy, endurance, weight loss)
- Mix of study types and publication venues

**Result**: A curated corpus that provides comprehensive, balanced guidance across the supplement landscape.

## What You Get

### Full Transparency
Every recommendation includes:
- **Study title** and journal
- **Direct PubMed link** (you can read the studies yourself)
- **Study type** (meta-analysis, RCT, etc.)
- **Key findings** relevant to your question

### Evidence Grades
We rate the strength of evidence:
- **Grade A**: Strong evidence from multiple high-quality studies
- **Grade B**: Moderate evidence with some limitations
- **Grade C**: Limited or mixed evidence; more research needed
- **Grade D**: Insufficient evidence

### Personalized Recommendations
Our system considers:
- Your training goals (strength, muscle gain, endurance, etc.)
- Your weight (for proper dosing)
- Caffeine sensitivity
- Medications you're taking (for safety screening)
- Dietary preferences and protein intake

### Safety First
- Drug-supplement interaction screening using FDA data
- Highlighting of contraindications and side effects

## Why Trust EvidentFit?

### 1. Evidence First, Business Second
We may earn commissions from supplement purchases through affiliate links, but **our recommendations are never influenced by commissions**. Here's how we maintain independence:

- **Research-driven**: Recommendations come from our evidence analysis system, not affiliate programs
- **No pay-to-play**: Supplement companies cannot pay for better rankings or inclusion
- **Full disclosure**: We clearly label affiliate links and partnerships
- **Quality threshold**: We only recommend supplements with strong evidence (Grade A/B), regardless of commission rates
- **Alternative options**: We always mention multiple brands and generic options

**Our commitment**: If the research doesn't support a supplement, we won't recommend it‚Äîno matter how profitable it might be.

### 2. Independent Ownership
We're not owned by a supplement manufacturer, distributor, or conglomerate. Our recommendations are based on research, not corporate interests.

### 3. Cite-Only-Retrieved
Our AI can **only cite research it has actually retrieved** from PubMed. We've built technical safeguards to prevent hallucinated citations.

### 4. Conservative, Evidence-Based Dosing
Dosing recommendations come from published research protocols, not guesswork. We use evidence-based formulas like:
- Creatine monohydrate equivalent (CME) dosing
- Protein gap analysis (diet-first approach)
- Weight-adjusted caffeine dosing

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
We don't just scrape every paper on PubMed. We curate, evaluate, and balance to ensure high-quality, actionable guidance.

### 5. Open About Limitations
We tell you what we **don't** know. If evidence is weak, conflicting, or missing, we say so.

### 6. Long-Term Thinking
We're building EvidentFit for the long term. Losing your trust by pushing ineffective supplements would destroy our business. Our success depends on you getting real results and coming back.

## What We Don't Do

‚ùå Cherry-pick studies to support predetermined conclusions  
‚ùå Recommend proprietary blends or unproven compounds  
‚ùå Make exaggerated claims about supplement effectiveness  
‚ùå Provide medical advice (always consult healthcare providers)  
‚ùå Let commission rates influence our recommendations  
‚ùå Accept payment for better rankings or inclusion  

---

## Our Limitations

We believe in transparency about what our system can and cannot do:

1. **Abstract-based analysis**: We analyze study abstracts, not always full papers
2. **English-language focus**: Most research we access is in English
3. **No individualized medical advice**: We provide evidence-based education, not personalized medical recommendations
4. **Population variability**: What works in research populations may not work identically for everyone

## How We Make Money

We believe in transparency about our business model:

**Affiliate Commissions**: When you purchase supplements through our links, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you. This helps us keep the service running and continuously improving.

**Our Promise**: 
- Recommendations are **always** based on research evidence, not commission rates
- We disclose all affiliate relationships clearly
- You're never required to use our links‚Äîgeneric/brand alternatives are always mentioned
- If the research says "don't take this," we won't recommend it, regardless of potential earnings

**Why this model works**: Our reputation depends on you trusting our recommendations and getting real results. Short-term profit from pushing ineffective supplements would destroy long-term trust.
