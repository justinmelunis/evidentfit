          "content": "To investigate the efficacy and safety of creatine supplementation in fibromyalgia patients. A 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted. Fibromyalgia patients were randomly assigned to receive either creatine monohydrate or placebo in a double-blind manner. The patients were evaluated at baseline and after 16 weeks. Muscle function, aerobic conditioning, cognitive function, quality of sleep, quality of life, kidney function, and adverse events were assessed. Muscle phosphorylcreatine content was measured through (31) P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After the intervention, the creatine group presented higher muscle phosphorylcreatine content when compared with the placebo group (+80.3% versus -2.7%; P = 0.04). Furthermore, the creatine group presented greater muscle strength than the placebo group in the leg press and chest press exercises (+9.8% and +1.2% for creatine versus -0.5% and -7.2% for placebo, respectively; P = 0.02 and P = 0.002, respectively). Isometric strength was greater in the creatine group than in the placebo group (+6.4% versus -3.2%; P = 0.007). However, no general changes were observed in aerobic conditioning, pain, cognitive function, quality of sleep, and quality of life. Food intake remained unaltered and no side effects were reported. Creatine supplementation increased intramuscular phosphorylcreatine content and improved lower- and upper-body muscle function, with minor changes in other fibromyalgia features. These findings introduce creatine supplementation as a useful dietary intervention to improve muscle function in fibromyalgia patients.",

It improves muscle performance in healthy individuals and might be helpful for treating myopathies. To evaluate the efficacy of oral creatine supplementation in muscle diseases. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register in May 2004 for randomised trials using the search term 'creatine'. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2005) using the same search term. We adapted this strategy to search MEDLINE (PubMed, from January 1966 to September 2005) and EMBASE (from January 1980 to May 2004). We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials identified, contacted the authors and known experts in the field and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data. Types of studies: randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials. people of all ages with hereditary muscle disease. Types of intervention: any creatine supplementation of at least 0.03 g/kg body weight/day. change in muscle strength measured by quantitative muscle testing. change in muscle strength measured by manual muscle testing, change in energy parameters assessed by 31 phosphorous spectroscopy, change in muscle mass or a surrogate for muscle mass, adverse events. Two authors independently applied the selection criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Some missing data were obtained from investigators. Twelve trials, including 266 participants, met the selection criteria. One trial compared creatine and glutamine treatment with placebo. In trials with 138 participants with muscular dystrophies treated with creatine, there was a significant increase in maximum voluntary contraction in the creatine group compared to placebo, with a weighted mean difference of 8.47% (95% confidence intervals 3.55 to 13.38). There was also an increase in lean body mass during creatine treatment compared to placebo (weighted mean difference 0.63 kg, 95% confidence intervals 0.02 to 1.25). No trial reported any clinically relevant adverse event. In trials with 33 participants with metabolic myopathies treated with creatine, there was no significant difference in maximum voluntary contraction between the creatine and placebo group (weighted mean difference -2.26%, confidence intervals -6.29 to 1.78). One trial reported a significant increase in muscle pain during high-dose creatine treatment (150 mg/kg body weight) in glycogen storage disease type V. Evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that short- and medium-term creatine treatment improves muscle strength in people with muscular dystrophies, and is well-tolerated. Evidence from randomised controlled trials does not show significant improvement in muscle strength in metabolic myopathies. High-dose creatine in glycogenosis type V increased muscle pain.",

          "content": "Creatine is a widely used ergogenic aid that enhances muscle strength and lean mass. However, concerns have been raised about the potential role in promoting hair loss by increasing dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Currently, there is no direct evidence examining the relationship between creatine supplementation and hair follicle health. Therefore, the purpose was to determine the effects of 12\u2009weeks of creatine supplementation on androgen levels and hair follicle health in healthy young males. Forty-five resistance-trained males (ages 18-40 years) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a creatine monohydrate (5\u2009g/day) or placebo (5\u2009g maltodextrin/day) group. Participants maintained their habitual diets and training routines. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 12\u2009weeks to measure total testosterone, free testosterone, and DHT. Hair follicle health was assessed using the Trichogram test and the FotoFinder system (hair density, follicular unit count, and cumulative hair thickness). Statistical analyses were performed using repeated measures ANOVA, and potential outliers were examined through sensitivity analysis. Thirty-eight participants completed the study, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups.

          "content": "Creatine supplementation could be a nonexpensive, safe, and effective dietary intervention to counteract bone loss. The aim of this study was to investigate whether long-term creatine supplementation can improve bone health in older, postmenopausal women. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial was conducted between November 2011 and December 2017 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Two hundred postmenopausal women with osteopenia were randomly allocated to receive either creatine monohydrate (3 g/d) or placebo for 2 years. At baseline and after 12 and 24 months, we assessed areal bone mineral density (aBMD; primary outcome), lean and fat mass (through dual X-ray absorptiometry), volumetric BMD and bone microarchitecture parameters, biochemical bone markers, physical function and strength, and the number of falls and fractures. Possible adverse effects were self-reported. Lumbar spine (p < .001), femoral neck (p < .001), and total femur aBMD (p = .032) decreased across time; however, no interaction effect was observed (all p > .050). Bone markers, microarchitecture parameters, and the number of falls/fractures were not changed with creatine (all p > .050). Lean mass and appendicular skeletal muscle mass increased throughout the intervention (p < .001), with no additive effect of creatine (p = .731 and p = .397, respectively). Creatine did not affect health-related laboratory parameters. Creatine supplementation more than 2 years did not improve bone health in older, postmenopausal women with osteopenia, nor did it affect lean mass or muscle function in this population. This refutes the long-lasting notion that this dietary supplement alone has osteogenic or anabolic properties in the long run. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT: 01472393.",

          "title": "The Additive Effects of Creatine Supplementation and Exercise Training in an Aging Population: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.",
          "content": "The role of creatine supplementation in young athletes and bodybuilders is well established including ergogenic properties of muscular hypertrophy, strength, power, and endurance. Whether the benefits of creatine supplementation translate to an aging population with moderate training stimulus remains unclear especially in regard to gender, creatine dose, and duration. This systematic review assessed whether creatine supplementation combined with exercise results in additive improvements in indices of skeletal muscle, bone, and mental health over exercise alone in healthy older adults. PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were utilized to identify randomized controlled trials of creatine supplementation combined with exercise in an aging population with additional predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, and performed quality assessments using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Seventeen studies were comprehensively reviewed according to categories of strength, endurance, functional capacity, body composition, cognition, and safety. These studies suggest that any additive ergogenic creatine effects on upper and/or lower body strength, functional capacity, and lean mass in an older population would require a continuous and daily low-dose creatine supplementation combined with at least 12 weeks of resistance training. Potential creatine specific increases in regional bone mineral density of the femur are possible but may require at least 1 year of creatine supplementation combined with moderate resistance training, and additional long-term clinical trials are warranted. The limited data suggested no additive effects of creatine over exercise alone on indices of mental health. The beneficial effects of creatine supplementation are more consistent in older women than in men. Creatine monohydrate is safe to use in older adults. While creatine in conjunction with moderate- to high-intensity exercise in an aging population may improve skeletal muscle health, additional studies are needed to determine the effective dosing and duration paradigm for potential combined creatine and exercise effects on bone and cognition in older adults.",

Efficacy of alternative forms of creatine supplementation on improving performance and body composition in healthy subjects: a systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 36(9): 2663-2670, 2022-Novel forms of creatine have appeared in the marketplace with substantial claims of improved efficacy compared to creatine monohydrate (CrM). The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review on alternative forms of creatine to determine (a) whether they are effective ergogenic aids and (b) whether they outperform CrM. A separate comparison was conducted to determine average cost of various forms of creatine. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar were systematically reviewed according to PRISMA guidelines. The design of the review was set to answer the PICOS model (subjects, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design). Seventeen randomized placebo controlled clinical trials examining exercise performance outcomes and body composition were included in the analysis. Magnesium-creatine chelate and creatine citrate, malate, ethyl ester, nitrate, and pyruvate were the only forms researched in the literature. Of these studies, only 3 studies compared the alternative creatine form to CrM, making it difficult to compare efficacy to CrM. There were no consistent findings of performance enhancement among alternative forms of creatine when compared to placebo. A review of the marketplace shows that CrM is the lowest cost form of creatine. Due to the paucity of studies on alternative forms of creatine as well as high prices on the market of these alternative forms, CrM remains as the most extensively studied form of creatine that shows efficacy, safety, and lowest cost to consumer.",

          "content": "The efficacy of creatine replacement through supplementation for the optimization of physical function in the population at risk of functional disability is unclear. We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from inception to November 2022. Studies included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing creatine supplementation with placebos in older adults and adults with chronic disease. The primary outcome was physical function measured by the sit-to-stand test after pooling data using random-effects modeling. We also performed a Bayesian meta-analysis to describe the treatment effect in probability terms. Secondary outcomes included other measures of physical function, muscle function, and body composition. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We identified 33 RCTs, comprising 1076 participants. From six trials reporting the primary outcome, the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-1.00; I\u2009=\u200962%; P\u2009=\u20090.04); using weakly informative priors, the posterior probability that creatine supplementation improves physical function was 66.7%. Upper-body muscle strength (SMD: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.06-0.44; I\u2009=\u20090%; P\u2009=\u20090.01), handgrip strength (SMD 0.23; 95% CI: 0.01-0.45; I\u2009=\u20090%; P\u2009=\u20090.04), and lean tissue mass (MD 1.08\u2009kg; 95% CI: 0.77-1.38; I\u2009=\u200926%; P\u2009<\u20090.01) improved with creatine supplementation. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was low or very low because of a high risk of bias. Creatine supplementation improves sit-to-stand performance, muscle function, and lean tissue mass. It is crucial to conduct high-quality prospective RCTs to confirm these hypotheses (PROSPERO number, CRD42023354929).",

          "content": "Our purpose was to examine the effects of 2 yr of creatine monohydrate supplementation and exercise on bone health in postmenopausal women. Two hundred and thirty-seven postmenopausal women (mean age, 59 yr) were randomized to receive creatine (0.14 g\u00b7kg -1 \u00b7d -1 ) or placebo during a resistance training (3 d\u00b7wk -1 ) and walking (6 d\u00b7wk -1 ) program for 2 yr. Our primary outcome was the femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD), with lumbar spine BMD and proximal femur geometric properties as the secondary outcomes. Compared with placebo, creatine supplementation had no effect on BMD of the femoral neck (creatine: 0.725 \u00b1 0.110 to 0.712 \u00b1 0.100 g\u00b7cm -2 ; placebo: 0.721 \u00b1 0.102 to 0.706 \u00b1 0.097 g\u00b7cm -2 ), total hip (creatine: 0.879 \u00b1 0.118 to 0.872 \u00b1 0.114 g\u00b7cm -2 ; placebo: 0.881 \u00b1 0.111 to 0.873 \u00b1 0.109 g\u00b7cm -2 ), or lumbar spine (creatine: 0.932 \u00b1 0.133 to 0.925 \u00b1 0.131 g\u00b7cm -2 ; placebo: 0.923 \u00b1 0.145 to 0.915 \u00b1 0.143 g\u00b7cm -2 ). Creatine significantly maintained section modulus (1.35 \u00b1 0.29 to 1.34 \u00b1 0.26 vs 1.34 \u00b1 0.25 to 1.28 \u00b1 0.23 cm 3 (placebo), P = 0.0011), predictive of bone bending strength, and buckling ratio (10.8 \u00b1 2.6 to 11.1 \u00b1 2.2 vs 11.0 \u00b1 2.6 to 11.6 \u00b1 2.7 (placebo), P = 0.011), predictive of reduced cortical bending under compressive loads, at the narrow part of the femoral neck. Creatine reduced walking time over 80 m (48.6 \u00b1 5.6 to 47.1 \u00b1 5.4 vs 48.3 \u00b1 4.5 to 48.2 \u00b1 4.9 s (placebo), P = 0.0008) but had no effect on muscular strength (i.e., one-repetition maximum) during bench press (32.1 \u00b1 12.7 to 42.6 \u00b1 14.1 vs 30.6 \u00b1 10.9 to 41.4 \u00b1 14 kg (placebo)) and hack squat (57.6 \u00b1 21.6 to 84.4 \u00b1 28.1 vs 56.6 \u00b1 24.0 to 82.7 \u00b1 25.0 kg (placebo)). In the subanalysis of valid completers, creatine increased lean tissue mass compared with placebo (40.8 \u00b1 5.7 to 43.1 \u00b1 5.9 vs 40.4 \u00b1 5.3 to 42.0 \u00b1 5.2 kg (placebo), P = 0.046).

          "content": "This study aimed to compare the effects of an 8-week creatine (CR) or placebo (PL) supplementation on muscle strength, thickness, endurance, and body composition employing different training paradigms with blood flow restriction (BFR) vs. traditional resistance training (TRAD). Seventeen healthy males were randomized between the PL (\u00a0=\u00a09) and CR (\u00a0=\u00a08) groups. Participants were trained unilaterally utilizing a within-between subject bicep curl exercise where each arm was allocated to TRAD or BFR for 8 weeks. Muscular strength, thickness, endurance, and body composition were evaluated. Creatine supplementation promoted increases in muscle thickness in TRAD and BFR compared with their placebo counterparts, however, without a significant difference between treatments (\u00a0=\u00a00.349). TRAD training increased maximum strength (1 repetition maximum (1RM)) compared with BFR after 8 weeks of training (\u00a0=\u00a00.021). Repetitions to failure at 30% of 1RM were increased in the BFR-CR group compared with the TRAD-CR group (\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Repetitions to failure at 70% 1RM were increased from weeks 0-4 (\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 4-8 (\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in all groups. Creatine supplementation exerted a hypertrophic effect when utilized with TRAD and BFR paradigms and increased muscle performance at 30% 1RM when utilized in conjunction with BFR. Therefore, creatine supplementation seems to amplify muscle adaptation following a BFR program.

Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of creatine on muscle function and metabolism, aerobic capacity, fatigue, physical activity, and quality of life (QOL), as well as its safety. We conducted a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, multiple-baseline design; patients were assigned to creatine or placebo. Feasibility was assessed using attended study visits, completed study procedures, and adherence. Muscle function, aerobic capacity, and muscle strength were assessed with standardized exercise tests. Muscle metabolism was assessed using a 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy protocol. Fatigue, physical activity, and QOL were assessed by questionnaires. Statistical significance was estimated using a randomization (permutation) test. Changes in outcome measures taken at baseline and end-of-study were calculated using paired -tests. Median (range) adherence to the study drug was 88.5% (20.5-95.5%) and the proportion of subjects with 80% adherence or higher was 76.9%. There were no missed study visits. There were no statistically significant changes in muscle function, strength, aerobic capacity, disease activity, fatigue, physical activity, or QOL while subjects were receiving creatine compared to placebo. There were statistically significant adaptations in muscle metabolism (e.g., decrease in change in muscle pH following exercise, and decrease in phosphate/phosphocreatine ratio) at the end-of-study compared to baseline. There were no significant adverse effects. Creatine supplementation in children with JDM is feasible to study, and is safe and well-tolerated; it may lead to improvements in muscle metabolism.",

          "content": "There is robust evidence that creatine monohydrate supplementation can enhance short-term high-intensity exercise in athletes. However, the effect of creatine monohydrate supplementation on aerobic performance and its role during aerobic activities is still controversial. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the supplementation effects of creatine monohydrate on endurance performance in a trained population. The search strategy in this systematic review and meta-analysis was designed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were explored from inception until 19 May, 2022. Only human experimental trials, controlled with a placebo group, evaluating the effects of creatine monohydrate supplementation on endurance performance in a trained population were analyzed in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. A total of 13 studies satisfied all the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The results for the pooled meta-analysis showed a non-significant change in endurance performance after creatine monohydrate supplementation in a trained population (p\u2009=\u20090.47), with a trivial negative effect (pooled standardized mean difference\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.07 [95% confidence interval\u2009-\u20090.32 to 0.18]; I\u2009=\u200934.75%).

          "content": "A short period of leg immobilization leads to rapid loss of muscle mass and strength. Creatine supplementation has been shown to increase lean body mass in active individuals and can be used to augment gains in muscle mass and strength during prolonged resistance-type exercise training. Our objective was to investigate whether creatine loading can attenuate the loss of muscle mass and strength during short-term leg immobilization. Healthy young men (n\u00a0=\u00a030; aged 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years; body mass index [BMI] 23.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0kg/m) were randomly assigned to either a creatine or a placebo group. Subjects received placebo or creatine supplements (20\u00a0g/d) for 5\u00a0days before one leg was immobilized by means of a full-leg cast for 7\u00a0days. Muscle biopsies were taken before creatine loading, prior to and immediately after leg immobilization, and after 7\u00a0days of subsequent recovery. Quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA) (computed tomography [CT] scan) and leg muscle strength (one-repetition maximum [1-RM] knee extension) were assessed before and immediately after immobilization and after 1\u00a0week of recovery. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data are presented consistently as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error of the mean (SEM). There was a significant overall increase in muscle total creatine content following the 5-day loading phase (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049), which appeared driven by an increase in the creatine group (from 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 to 107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0mmol/kg dry muscle) with no apparent change in the placebo group (from 88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mmol/kg; p\u00a0=\u00a00.066 for time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0treatment interaction). Quadriceps muscle CSA had declined by 465\u00a0\u00b1\u00a059 and 425\u00a0\u00b1\u00a069\u00a0mm (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the creatine and placebo group, respectively, with no differences between groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.76). Leg muscle strength decreased from 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0kg in the creatine and from 59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 to 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0kg in the placebo group, with no differences between groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.20). Muscle fiber size did not change significantly over time in either group (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). When non-responders to creatine loading were excluded (n\u00a0=\u00a06), responders (n\u00a0=\u00a08; total creatine content increasing from 70 to 106\u00a0mmol/kg) showed similar findings, with no signs of preservation of muscle mass or strength during immobilization. During the subsequent recovery phase, no differences in muscle mass or strength were found between the two groups (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Creatine supplementation prior to and during leg immobilization does not prevent or attenuate the loss of muscle mass or strength during short-term muscle disuse.

          "content": "Multiple pilot studies, including one in colorectal cancer patients, suggest that creatine, an amino acid derivative, augments muscle, improves strength, and thereby could palliate the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, incurable patients with this syndrome were assigned creatine (20\u2009g/day load\u00d75 days followed by 2\u2009g/day orally) versus identical placebo. Patients were weighed once a week for 1\u2009month and then monthly. Patients were also assessed over 1\u2009month for appetite and quality of life (validated questionnaires), fist grip strength, body composition (bioelectrical impedance), and adverse events. The primary endpoint was 10% or greater weight gain from baseline during the first month. Within this combined cohort of 263 evaluable patients (134 received creatine and 129 placebo), only 3 gained\u2009\u226510% of their baseline weight by 1\u2009month: two creatine-treated and the other placebo-exposed (P\u2009=\u20091.00). Questionnaire data on appetite, quality of life, and activities of daily living showed no statistically significant differences between groups. Similarly, no statistically significant differences between groups were observed for fist-grip strength or body composition. Rates and severity of adverse events were comparable between groups. Finally, a median survival of 230 and 239 days were observed in the creatine and placebo groups, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.70). Creatine, as prescribed in this trial, had no effect on the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome.",

          "title": "Creatine Supplementation Beyond Athletics: Benefits of Different Types of Creatine for Women, Vegans, and Clinical Populations-A Narrative Review.",
          "content": "Creatine monohydrate supplementation is widely used by athletes in high-intensity, power-based sports due to its ability to enhance short-term performance by increasing intramuscular phosphocreatine (PCr) stores, which aid in ATP resynthesis during intense muscle contractions. However, emerging evidence suggests that creatine monohydrate offers benefits beyond athletic performance. This narrative review explores the literature supporting the advantages of creatine supplementation in women, vegans, and clinical populations. In women, who typically have lower baseline intramuscular creatine levels, supplementation may help alleviate fatigue-related symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle, particularly during the early follicular and luteal phases. For vegans and vegetarians, who often have reduced creatine stores due to the absence of creatine-rich animal products in their diet, supplementation can improve both physical and cognitive performance while supporting adherence to plant-based diets. Additionally, creatine supplementation holds potential for various clinical populations. It may mitigate muscle wasting in conditions such as sarcopenia and cachexia, support neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Huntington's, improve exercise capacity in cardiovascular diseases, and enhance energy metabolism in chronic fatigue syndrome. Creatine may also aid recovery from traumatic brain injury by promoting brain energy metabolism and reducing neuronal damage. In conclusion, creatine monohydrate supplementation can enhance physical performance, cognitive function, and overall health in women, vegans, and clinical populations by addressing creatine deficiencies, improving energy metabolism, and supporting recovery from physical and neurological challenges. Most available evidence supports the effectiveness of creatine monohydrate, which should be considered the preferred form of creatine supplementation over other variants. Additionally, proper creatine dosing is essential to maximize benefits and minimize potential adverse effects that may arise from chronic ingestion of excessively high doses.",

          "content": "Much attention has been given to determining the influence of total protein intake and protein source on gains in lean body mass (LBM) and strength in response to resistance exercise training (RET). Acute studies indicate that whey protein, likely related to its higher leucine content, stimulates muscle protein synthesis to a greater extent than proteins such as soy and casein. Less clear is the extent to which the type of protein supplemented impacts strength and LBM in long-term studies (\u22656 weeks). Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effect of supplementation with soy protein to animal protein supplementation on strength and LBM in response to RET. Nine studies involving 266 participants suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis were identified. Five studies compared whey with soy protein, and four studies compared soy protein with other proteins (beef, milk, or dairy protein). Meta-analysis showed that supplementing RET with whey or soy protein resulted in significant increases in strength but found no difference between groups (bench press: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.02, p\u2009=\u2009.90; squat: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.22, p\u2009=\u2009.64). There was no significant effect of whey or soy alone (n\u2009=\u20095) on LBM change and no differences between groups (\u03c7\u2009=\u20090.00, p\u2009=\u2009.96). Strength and LBM both increased significantly in the \"other protein\" and the soy groups (n\u2009=\u20099), but there were no between-group differences (bench: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.02, p\u2009=\u2009.88; squat: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.78, p\u2009=\u2009.38; and LBM: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.06, p\u2009=\u2009.80). The results of this meta-analysis indicate that soy protein supplementation produces similar gains in strength and LBM in response to RET as whey protein.",

          "content": "As a relatively novel approach to enhancing skeletal muscle health, mixed protein supplementation has shown similar responses to whey protein. However, no previous studies have examined its impact on golf swing performance. This study aimed to examine the effect of mixed protein supplementation on the swing performance and muscle strength of casual golfers. Sixty participants with a handicap of less than 20 were recruited and randomly assigned to a double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. The participants were divided into two groups: a mixed protein group (MG, \u2009=\u200930), and a placebo control group (CG, \u2009=\u200930). They were instructed to ingest either a supplement containing casein calcium, whey protein, and isolated pea protein, or a placebo, once daily for 8\u2009weeks. Pre- and posttests consisted of anthropometric measurements, muscle strength (isokinetic knee and trunk strength, and handgrip strength), 2-minute push-ups, balance, and golf swing performance using a driver and 7-iron. After the 8-week supplementation period, ANCOVA, using baseline values as covariates, revealed significant differences for driver distance (\u2009=\u2009.004) and driver ball speed (\u2009<\u2009.001). MG significantly increased driver distance by 5.17\u2009\u00b1\u200912.8\u2009m (\u2009=\u2009.046), driver ball speed by 1.36\u2009\u00b1\u20092.87\u2009m/s (\u2009=\u2009.021). Additionally, significantly improvements were observed in hand grip strength (+2.12\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47\u2009kg, \u2009=\u2009.004), two-minute push-ups (+4.89\u2009\u00b1\u20098.14 reps, \u2009=\u2009.004), and balance score (-0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69\u2009min, \u2009=\u2009.009). No significant differences were observed in body composition parameters (\u2009>\u2009.05).

We evaluated the feasibility and effects of resistance training with and without protein supplementation on lean body mass and muscle strength among survivors. This double-blind placebo-controlled trial enrolled survivors \u226518 to <45 yr old. Participants were randomized to resistance training with protein supplement (21 g whey protein per day, 90 kcal) (RT + S) or resistance training with placebo (sucrose, 90 kcal) (RT + P). Participants received educational materials, access to a local fitness center, and a tailored resistance training program with tapered supervision. Participant retention and adherence were used to evaluate feasibility. Lean body mass and muscle strength were assessed at baseline and 24 wk, using dual x-ray absorptiometry, and dynamometer testing or one-repetition maximum testing, respectively. Mean changes were compared with two-way ANOVA. Of 70 participants randomized, 57 completed the 24-wk intervention (24 in RT + S, 33 in RT + P). The RT + S group completed 74.8% and the RT + P group completed 67.0% of exercise sessions. Mean \u00b1 SD age for those who completed was 33.1 \u00b1 7.0 yr, 67% were White and 47% female.

Participants were randomized to consume a protein supplement (40\u00a0g of casein) before sleep (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or in the afternoon (n\u00a0=\u00a08), or an isoenergetic placebo (40\u00a0g of carbohydrates) before sleep (n\u00a0=\u00a08). Indicators of fatigue/recovery (Hooper index, Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes, countermovement jump), body composition, and performance (1-, 5-, and 20-minute time trials, as well as the estimated critical power) were assessed as study outcomes. The training camp resulted in a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) increase in training loads (. training stress score of 659\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0122 per week during the preceding month versus 1207\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0122 during the training camp), which induced an increase in fatigue indicators (e.g. time effect for Hooper index p <\u00a00.001) and a decrease in performance (e.g. time effect for critical power p =\u00a00.002). Protein intake was very high in all the participants (>2.5\u00a0g/kg on average), with significantly higher levels found in the two protein supplement groups compared to the placebo group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No significant between-group differences were found for any of the analyzed outcomes (all p >\u00a00.05). Protein supplementation, whether administered before sleep or earlier in the day, exerts no beneficial effects during a short-term strenuous training period in professional cyclists, who naturally consume a high-protein diet.",

          "content": "Protein supplementation alone or combined with resistance training has been proposed to be effective in counteracting age-related losses of muscle mass and strength. To investigate the effect of protein supplementation alone or combined with light-intensity or heavy-load resistance exercise on muscle size, strength, and function in older adults. In a 1-y randomized controlled trial, 208 healthy older adults (>65 y) were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 interventions: 1) carbohydrate supplementation (CARB); 2) collagen protein supplementation (COLL); 3) whey protein supplementation (WHEY); 4) light-intensity resistance training 3-5 times/wk with whey protein supplementation (LITW); and 5) heavy resistance training 3 times weekly with whey protein supplementation (HRTW). Protein supplements contained 20 g protein\u00a0+\u00a010 g carbohydrate, whereas CARB contained 30 g of carbohydrates. All intervention groups received the supplement twice daily. The primary outcome was change in the quadriceps cross-sectional area (qCSA). Secondary outcomes included measures of lower extremity strength and power, functional capabilities, and body composition. There were 184 participants who completed the study. COLL and WHEY did not affect any measured parameter compared to CARB. Compared to WHEY, HRTW improved the qCSA size (between-group difference, +1.68 cm2; 95% CI, +0.41 to +2.95 cm2; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), as well as dynamic (+18.4 Nm; 95% CI, +10.1 to +26.6 Nm; P\u00a0<\u00a010-4) and isometric knee extensor strength (+23.9 Nm; 95% CI, +14.2 to +33.6 Nm; P\u00a0<\u00a010-5). LITW did not improve the qCSA size, but increased dynamic knee extensor strength compared to WHEY (+13.7 Nm; 95% CI, +5.3 and +22.1 Nm; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Recommending protein supplementation as a stand-alone intervention for healthy older individuals seems ineffective in improving muscle mass and strength. Only HRTW was effective in both preserving muscle mass and increasing strength. Thus, we recommend that future studies investigate strategies to increase long-term compliance to heavy resistance exercise in healthy older adults.

We aimed to assess the effect of whey protein supplementation alone or with vitamin D on lean mass (LM), strength, and function in older adults with or without sarcopenia or frailty. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that investigated the effect of whey protein supplementation with or without vitamin D on sarcopenia outcomes in healthy and sarcopenic or frail older adults were included. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for LM, muscle strength, and physical function data. The analysis showed that whey protein supplementation had no effect on LM and muscle strength; nevertheless, a significant improvement was found in physical function (SMD = 0.561; 95% confidence interval [CIs]: 0.256, 0.865, n = 33), particularly gait speed (GS). On the contrary, whey protein supplementation significantly improved LM (SMD = 0.982; 95% CI: 0.228, 1.736; n = 11), appendicular lean mass and physical function (SMD = 1.211; 95% CI: 0.588, 1.834; n = 16), and GS in sarcopenic/frail older adults. By contrast, co-supplementation with vitamin D enhanced LM gains (SMD =0.993; 95% CI: 0.112, 1.874; n = 11), muscle strength (SMD =2.005; 95% CI: 0.975, 3.035; n = 11), and physical function (SMD = 3.038; 95% CI: 2.196, 3.879; n = 18) significantly. Muscle strength and physical function improvements after whey protein supplementation plus vitamin D were observed without resistance exercise (RE) and short study duration subgroups. Moreover, the combination of whey protein and vitamin D with RE did not enhance the effect of RE. Whey protein supplementation improved LM and function in sarcopenic/frail older adults but had no positive effect in healthy older persons. By contrast, our meta-analysis showed that co-supplementation with whey protein and vitamin D is effective, particularly in healthy older adults, which is likely owing, we propose, to the correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.

To determine the impact of protein supplementation during chronic endurance training on aerobic capacity, body composition and exercise performance in healthy and clinical populations. A systematic database search was conducted for randomised controlled trials addressing the effects of protein supplementation during endurance training on aerobic capacity, body composition and exercise performance in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Meta-analyses were performed to outline the overall effects of protein supplementation with all studies containing endurance training components. The effects of endurance training and add-on effects of protein supplementation were evaluated by the meta-analyses with endurance training-focused studies. Nineteen studies and 1162 participants contributed to the analyses. Compared with the control group, the protein supplementation group demonstrated greater improvements in aerobic capacity measured by mixed peak oxygen uptake (V\u0307O) and peak workload power (W) (standardised mean difference [SMD]\u00a0=\u00a00.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05 to 0.67), and V\u0307O (mean difference [MD]\u00a0=\u00a00.89\u00a0mL\u2027kg\u2027min, 95% CI: 0.07 to 1.70); had a greater lean mass gain (MD\u00a0=\u00a00.32\u00a0kg, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.58); and had a greater improvement in time trial performance (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-29.1s, 95% CI:-55.3 to\u00a0-3.0).

          "content": "This trial aimed to examine the effect of whey protein hydrolysate intake before and after exercise sessions on endurance performance and recovery in elite orienteers during a training camp. Eighteen elite orienteers participated in a randomized controlled intervention trial during a 1-week training camp (13 exercise sessions). Half of the runners (PRO-CHO) ingested a protein drink before (0.3 g kg(-1)) and a protein-carbohydrate drink after (0.3 g protein kg(-1) and 1 g carbohydrate kg(-1)) each exercise session. The others ingested energy and time-matched carbohydrate drinks (CHO). A 4-km run-test with 20 control points was performed before and on the last day of the intervention. Blood and saliva were obtained in the mornings, before and after run-tests, and after the last training session. During the intervention, questionnaires were fulfilled regarding psychological sense of performance capacity and motivation. PRO-CHO and not CHO improved performance in the 4-km run-test (interaction p < .05). An increase in serum creatine kinase was observed during the week, which was greater in CHO than PRO-CHO (interaction p < .01). Lactate dehydrogenase (p < .001) and cortisol (p = .057) increased during the week, but the change did not differ between groups. Reduction in sense of performance capacity during the intervention was greater in CHO (p < .05) than PRO-CHO. In conclusion, ingestion of whey protein hydrolysate before and after each exercise session improves performance and reduces markers of muscle damage during a strenuous 1-week training camp. The results indicate that protein supplementation in conjunction with each exercise session facilitates the recovery from strenuous training in elite orienteers.",

Consequently, it is generally accepted that protein supplementation is required to maximize the adaptive response of the skeletal muscle to prolonged resistance-type exercise training. However, there is much discrepancy in the literature regarding the proposed benefits of protein supplementation during prolonged resistance-type exercise training in younger and older populations. The objective of the study was to define the efficacy of protein supplementation to augment the adaptive response of the skeletal muscle to prolonged resistance-type exercise training in younger and older populations. A systematic review of interventional evidence was performed through the use of a random-effects meta-analysis model. Data from the outcome variables fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass, type I and II muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) leg press strength were collected from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of dietary protein supplementation during prolonged (>6 wk) resistance-type exercise training. Data were included from 22 RCTs that included 680 subjects. Protein supplementation showed a positive effect for FFM (weighted mean difference: 0.69 kg; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.91 kg; P < 0.00001) and 1-RM leg press strength (weighted mean difference: 13.5 kg; 95% CI: 6.4, 20.7 kg; P < 0.005) compared with a placebo after prolonged resistance-type exercise training in younger and older subjects.

Healthy male US Marine recruits from six platoons (US Marine Corps Base, Parris Island, SC; n = 387; 18.9 +/- 0.1 yr, 74.7 +/- 1.1 kg, 13.8 +/- 0.4% body fat) were randomly assigned to three treatments within each platoon. Nutrients supplemented immediately postexercise during the 54-day basic training were either placebo (0 g carbohydrate, 0 g protein, 0 g fat), control (8, 0, 3), or protein supplement (8, 10, 3). Subjects and observers making measurements and data analysis were blinded to subject groupings. Compared with placebo and control groups, the protein-supplemented group had an average of 33% fewer total medical visits, 28% fewer visits due to bacterial/viral infections, 37% fewer visits due to muscle/joint problems, and 83% fewer visits due to heat exhaustion. Recruits experiencing heat exhaustion had greater body mass, lean, fat, and water losses. Muscle soreness immediately postexercise was reduced by protein supplementation vs. placebo and control groups on both days 34 and 54. Postexercise protein supplementation may not only enhance muscle protein deposition but it also has significant potential to positively impact health, muscle soreness, and tissue hydration during prolonged intense exercise training, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention of health problems in severely stressed exercising populations.",

          "content": "This randomized trial compared pea protein, whey protein, and water-only supplementation on muscle damage, inflammation, delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), and physical fitness test performance during a 5-day period after a 90-min eccentric exercise bout in non-athletic non-obese males ( = 92, ages 18-55 years). The two protein sources (0.9 g protein/kg divided into three doses/day) were administered under double blind procedures. The eccentric exercise protocol induced significant muscle damage and soreness, and reduced bench press and 30-s Wingate performance. Whey protein supplementation significantly attenuated post-exercise blood levels for biomarkers of muscle damage compared to water-only, with large effect sizes for creatine kinase and myoglobin during the fourth and fifth days of recovery (Cohen's d > 0.80); pea protein versus water supplementation had an intermediate non-significant effect (Cohen's d < 0.50); and no significant differences between whey and pea protein were found. Whey and pea protein compared to water supplementation had no significant effects on post-exercise DOMS and the fitness tests. In conclusion, high intake of whey protein for 5 days after intensive eccentric exercise mitigated the efflux of muscle damage biomarkers, with the intake of pea protein having an intermediate effect.",

          "content": "This review evaluated the effects of milk-based protein supplementation on resistance training (RT)-induced gains in lean body mass or fat free mass (LBM/FFM) and muscle strength for older adults. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and EBSCOhost/SPORTDiscus was conducted. Eligibility criteria: Randomized controlled trials comparing all types of milk-based protein supplements with control supplements for the training older adults at mean age \u2265 60 y. Twenty studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, whilst seventeen studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. A dose of 10-15 g of milk protein supplementation was sufficient to augment RT-induced LBM/FFM. Intriguingly, four out of five studies show negative effect of whey protein supplementation at the same dose range (or even higher) compared with control supplementation (-0.49 kg, 95% CI: -0.69, -0.29, I = 14%, Z = 4.82,  < 0.001). For milk-based protein supplementation, RT-induced improvements in muscle strength were observed only when the protein doses \u226522 g (+0.66 kg, 95% CI: 0.07, 1.25, I = 0%, Z = 2.18,  = 0.03). Conclusion: Milk protein is superior to whey protein in enhancing RT-induced LBM/FFM gains for older adults. Optimal daily protein intake can dilute the protein supplementation effect.",

          "content": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of whey protein supplementation on myofibrillar protein synthesis (myoPS) and muscle recovery over a 7-d period of intensified resistance training (RT). In a double-blind randomised parallel group design, 16 resistance-trained men aged 18 to 35 years completed a 7-d RT protocol, consisting of three lower-body RT sessions on non-consecutive days. Participants consumed a controlled diet (146 kJ\u00b7kg\u00b7d, 1.7 g\u00b7kg\u00b7d protein) with either a whey protein supplement or an isonitrogenous control (0.33 g\u00b7kg\u00b7d protein). To measure myoPS, 400 ml of deuterium oxide (DO) (70 atom %) was ingested the day prior to starting the study and m. vastus lateralis biopsies were taken before and after RT-intervention. Myofibrillar fractional synthetic rate (myoFSR) was calculated via deuterium labelling of myofibrillar-bound alanine, measured by gas chromatography-pyrolysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-Pyr-IRMS). Muscle recovery parameters (i.e., countermovement jump height, isometric-squat force, muscle soreness and serum creatine kinase) were assessed daily. MyoFSR PRE was 1.6 (0.2) %\u2219d (mean (SD)). Whey protein supplementation had no effect on myoFSR ( = 0.771) or any recovery parameter ( = 0.390-0.989). Over an intense 7-d RT protocol, 0.33 g\u00b7kg\u00b7d of supplemental whey protein does not enhance day-to-day measures of myoPS or postexercise recovery in resistance-trained men.",

A 12-month randomized controlled double blind trial with a 43-month of post-trial follow-up. Porvoo, Finland. A total of 218 older (>74\u00a0years of age) community-dwelling people with sarcopenia. (1) Control with no supplementation; (2) isocaloric placebo; and (3) 20\u00a0g\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 whey-enriched protein supplementation. All participants were given instructions on home-based exercise, dietary protein, and vitamin D supplementation of 20\u00a0\u03bcg/d. Physical performance was assessed by short physical performance battery and continuous summary physical performance scores. Hand grip strength and calf intracellular resistance based skeletal muscle index were measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy. The measurements were performed at 0, 6, and 12\u00a0months. The post-trial follow-up was performed by a postal questionnaire and national census record data. The participants were older (75-96\u00a0years of age) and mostly women (68%). The test supplements had no significant effects on physical performance; the 12-month changes for short physical performance battery were\u00a0-0.55,\u00a0-.05, and 0.03 points in control, isocaloric, and protein groups (P\u00a0=\u00a0.17), respectively. The changes in continuous summary physical performance scores were similar between the intervention groups (P\u00a0=\u00a0.76). The hand grip strength decreased significantly in all intervention groups, and the 12-month changes in calf intracellular resistance-based skeletal muscle index were minor and there were no differences between the intervention groups. One-half of the patients (56%) in both supplement groups reported mild gastrointestinal adverse effects. Differences were found neither in the all-cause mortality nor physical functioning in the post-trial follow-up. The whey-enriched protein supplementation in combination with low intensity home-based physical exercise did not attenuate the deterioration of muscle and physical performance in community-dwelling older people with sarcopenia.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia is a prevalent condition in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Therefore, a convenient and reliable method of monitoring muscle health is required. This study identified the utility of the phase angle (PhA) to estimate muscle health, and evaluated its changes following intradialytic neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and oral nutritional supplement interventions in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. This post-hoc analysis was conducted using data obtained from a 12-week multicenter randomized trial that examined the effects of NMES and protein supplementation. The participants were divided into four groups according to intradialytic NMES and protein supplementation. The PhA, muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance were measured every 4 weeks. Overall, 59 participants completed the study. PhA values were linearly associated with muscle mass and muscle strength. Additionally, high PhA levels indicated fast gait speed and shortened timed up-and-go test (TUG) results. We further evaluated the association between the PhA slope and muscle health-related parameters. In participants with the PhA slope &lt;0\u00b0 over 12 weeks, TUG results worsened over time, relative to those with a slope \u22650\u00b0 over 12 weeks, independent of age, sex, diabetes, and body mass index. NMES did not improve the PhA values over time; however, protein supplementation tended to increase the PhA values. PhA is a reliable marker for estimating and monitoring muscle health in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, and a strong association exists between PhA and TUG results.",

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize results from individual studies on the effects of caffeine intake on muscle strength and power. A search through eight databases was performed to find studies on the effects of caffeine on: (i) maximal muscle strength measured using 1 repetition maximum tests; and (ii) muscle power assessed by tests of vertical jump. Meta-analyses of standardized mean differences (SMD) between placebo and caffeine trials from individual studies were conducted using the random effects model. Ten studies on the strength outcome and ten studies on the power outcome met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analyses. Caffeine ingestion improved both strength (SMD\u2009=\u20090.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03, 0.36; \u2009=\u20090.023) and power (SMD\u2009=\u20090.17; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.34; \u2009=\u20090.047). A subgroup analysis indicated that caffeine significantly improves upper (SMD\u2009=\u20090.21; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.39; \u2009=\u20090.026) but not lower body strength (SMD\u2009=\u20090.15; 95% CI: -0.05, 0.34; \u2009=\u20090.147). The meta-analyses showed significant ergogenic effects of caffeine ingestion on maximal muscle strength of upper body and muscle power. Future studies should more rigorously control the effectiveness of blinding. Due to the paucity of evidence, additional findings are needed in the female population and using different forms of caffeine, such as gum and gel.",

          "title": "Does ergogenic effect of caffeine supplementation depend on CYP1A2 genotypes? A systematic review with meta-analysis.",
          "content": "The ergogenic effects of caffeine intake on exercise performance are well-established, even if differences exist among individuals in response to caffeine intake. The genetic variation of a specific gene, human cytochrome P450 enzyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) (rs762551), may be one reason for this difference. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the influence of CYP1A2 gene types on athletes' exercise performance after caffeine intake. A literature search through 4 databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) was conducted until March 2023. The effect size was expressed as the weighted mean difference (WMD) by calculating fixed effects meta-analysis if heterogeneity was not significant (I \u2264 50% and p \u2265 0.1). Subgroup analyses were performed based on AA and AC/CC genotype of CYP1A2. The final number of studies meeting the inclusion criteria was 12 (n\u202f=\u202f666 participants). The overall analysis showed that the cycling time trial significantly improved after caffeine intake (WMD\u202f=\u202f-0.48, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): -0.83 to -0.13, p\u202f=\u202f0.007). In subgroup analyses, acute caffeine intake improved cycling time trial only in individuals with the A allele (WMD\u202f=\u202f-0.90, 95%CI: -1.48 to -0.33, p\u202f=\u202f0.002), but not the C allele (WMD\u202f=\u202f-0.08, 95%CI: -0.32 to 0.17, p\u202f=\u202f0.53). Caffeine supplementation did not influence the Wingate (WMD\u202f=\u202f8.07, 95%CI: -22.04 to 38.18, p\u202f=\u202f0.60) or countermovement jump test (CMJ) performance (WMD\u202f=\u202f1.17, 95%CI: -0.02 to 2.36, p\u202f=\u202f0.05), and these outcomes were not influenced by CYP1A2 genotype. Participants with the CYP1A2 genotype with A allele improved their cycling time trials after caffeine supplementation. However, compared to placebo, acute caffeine supplementation failed to increase the Wingate or CMJ performance, regardless of CYP1A2 genotype.",

          "content": "The aim was to quantify the proportion of the literature on caffeine supplementation that reports habitual caffeine consumption, and determine the influence of habitual consumption on the acute exercise response to caffeine supplementation, using a systematic review and meta-analytic approach. Three databases were searched, and articles screened according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Three-level meta-analyses and meta-regression models were used to investigate the influence of habitual caffeine consumption on caffeine's overall ergogenic effect and within different exercise types (endurance, power, strength), in men and women, and in trained and untrained individuals. Sub-analyses were performed according to the following: acute relative dose (<\u20093, 3-6, >\u20096\u00a0mg/kg body mass [BM]); whether the acute caffeine dose provided was lower or higher than the mean daily caffeine dose; and the caffeine withdrawal period prior to the intervention (<\u200924, 24-48, >\u200948\u00a0h). Sixty caffeine studies included sufficient information on habitual consumption to be included in the meta-analysis. A positive overall effect of caffeine was shown in comparison to placebo (standard mean difference [SMD]\u2009=\u20090.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.30; p\u2009<\u20090.001) with no influence of relative habitual caffeine consumption (p\u2009=\u20090.59). Subgroup analyses showed a significant ergogenic effect when the caffeine dose was\u2009<\u20093\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.40; p\u2009=\u20090.003) and 3-6\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.21-0.32; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), but not\u2009>\u20096\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.11, 95% CI\u2009-\u20090.07 to 0.30; p\u2009=\u20090.23); when the dose was both higher (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.20-0.31; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and lower (SMD\u2009=\u20090.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.36; p\u2009=\u20090.006) than the habitual caffeine dose; and when withdrawal was\u2009<\u200924\u00a0h, 24-48\u00a0h, and\u2009>\u200948\u00a0h. Caffeine was effective for endurance, power, and strength exercise, with no influence (all p\u2009\u2265\u20090.23) of relative habitual caffeine consumption within exercise types. Habitual caffeine consumption did not modify the ergogenic effect of caffeine in male, female, trained or untrained individuals. Habitual caffeine consumption does not appear to influence the acute ergogenic effect of caffeine.",

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted in 15 men and 15 women recruited by their general practitioner. Participants abstained from caffeine for 48 h and were randomized to receive one capsule of placebo and then caffeine (6 mg/kg) or caffeine and then placebo with 1 wk in between. One hour after intervention, we measured reaction and movement times, postural stability, walking speed, cycling at 65% of expected maximal heart rate, perceived effort during cycling, maximal isometric arm flexion strength, and endurance. Analysis was by intention to treat, and P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Caffeine increased cycling endurance by 25% [95% confidence interval (CI): 13-38; P = 0.0001] and isometric arm flexion endurance by 54% (95% CI: 29-83; P = 0.0001). Caffeine also reduced the rating of perceived exertion after 5 min of cycling by 11% (95% CI: 5-17; P = 0.002) and postural stability with eyes open by 25% (95% CI: 2-53; P = 0.03). Caffeine ingestion did not affect muscle strength, walking speed, reaction, and movement times. At the end of the study, 46% of participants correctly identified when they received caffeine and placebo. Caffeine increased exercise endurance in healthy citizens aged > or =70 yr, but the participants' reasons for stopping the test may have varied between subjects, as the cycling test was done at approximately 55% of maximal oxygen consumption. Further studies are required to investigate whether caffeine can be utilized to improve the physical performance of elderly citizens.",

          "content": "Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the research literature assessing the effect of caffeine ingestion on maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) strength and muscular endurance. Thirty-four relevant studies between 1939 and 2008 were included in the meta-analyses of caffeine's effects on MVC strength (n = 27 studies) and muscular endurance (n = 23 studies). Effect sizes (ES) were calculated as the standardized mean difference and meta-analyses were completed using a random-effects model. Overall, caffeine ingestion was found to result in a small beneficial effect on MVC strength (overall ES = 0.19, P = 0.0003). However, caffeine appears to improve MVC strength primarily in the knee extensors (i.e., by approximately 7%, ES = 0.37) and not in other muscle groups such as the forearm or the knee flexors. In an attempt to offer a physiological mechanism behind caffeine's ability to improve MVC strength, a meta-analysis was run on ES from nine studies that measured percent muscle activation during MVC in trials comparing caffeine versus placebo; the overall ES (0.67) was highly significant (P = 0.00008) and of moderate to large size, thus implicating an effect of caffeine on the CNS. Caffeine ingestion was also found to exert a small beneficial effect on muscular endurance (overall ES = 0.28, P = 0.00005). However, it appears caffeine improves muscular endurance only when it is assessed using open (i.e., by approximately 18%, ES = 0.37) and not fixed end point tests. Overall, caffeine ingestion improves MVC strength and muscular endurance. The effect on strength appears exclusively in the knee extensors, and the effect on muscular endurance appears only detectable with open end point tests.",

However, there remains a significant gap in systematically evaluating its effects on time trial (TT) performance in cyclists. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the efficacy of caffeine ingestion to increase cycling TT performance in cyclists and to evaluate the optimal dosage range for maximum effect. A search of four databases was completed on 1 December 2023. The selected studies comprised crossover, placebo-controlled investigations into the effects of caffeine ingestion on cycling TT performance. Completion time (Time) and mean power output (MPO) were used as performance measures for TT. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model to assess the standardized mean differences (SMD) in individual studies. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analyses. Subgroup analysis showed that moderate doses of caffeine intake (4-6\u2009mg/kg) significantly improved cycling performance (SMD \u2009=\u2009-0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u2009-0.84\u2009~\u2009-0.26, \u2009<\u20090.01, \u2009=\u200935%; SMD \u2009=\u20090.44, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.09\u2009~\u20090.79, \u2009<\u20090.05, \u2009=\u200939%), while the effects of low doses (1-3\u2009mg/kg) of caffeine were not significant (SMD \u2009=\u2009-0.34, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.84\u2009~\u20090.17, \u2009=\u20090.19, \u2009=\u20090%; SMD \u2009=\u20090.31, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.02\u2009~\u20090.65, \u2009=\u20090.07, \u2009=\u20090%). A moderate dosage (4-6\u2009mg/kg) of caffeine, identified as the optimal dose range, can significantly improve the time trial performance of cyclists, while a low dose (1-3\u2009mg/kg) does not yield improvement. In addition, the improvements in completion time and mean power output resulting from a moderate dose of caffeine are essentially the same in cycling time trails.",

This study investigated the effect of caffeine on physical capacity in patients with intermittent claudication. This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study included 88 patients recruited by surgeons from outpatient clinics. The participants abstained from caffeine for 48 h before each test and then received either a placebo or oral caffeine (6 mg/kg). After 75 min, pain-free and maximal walking distance on a treadmill, perceived pain, reaction times, postural stability, maximal isometric knee extension strength, submaximal knee extension endurance and cognitive function were measured. The analysis was by intention to treat. Caffeine increased the pain-free walking distance by 20.0 (95 per cent confidence interval 3.7 to 38.8) per cent (P = 0.014), maximal walking distance by 26.6 (12.1 to 43.0) per cent (P < 0.001), muscle strength by 9.8 (3.0 to 17.0) per cent (P = 0.005) and endurance by 21.4 (1.2 to 45.7) per cent (P = 0.004). However, postural stability was reduced significantly, by 22.1 (11.7 to 33.4) per cent with eyes open (P < 0.001) and by 21.8 (7.6 to 37.8) per cent with eyes closed (P = 0.002). Neither reaction time nor cognition was affected. In patients with moderate intermittent claudication, caffeine increased walking distance, maximal strength and endurance, but affected balance adversely.",

          "content": "The benefits of oral caffeine intake to enhance several aspects of physical performance, such as aerobic endurance, strength, power, and muscle endurance performance, are well supported. However, how the physical performance benefits of caffeine supplementation are translated into better specific actions in intermittent sports during real or simulated competition has been the topic of fewer investigations, and their results need to be appropriately reviewed and meta-analyzed. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of acute caffeine intake on specific actions in intermittent sports involving decision making and high-intensity efforts (eg,\u00a0team, racket, and combat sports) during real or simulated competitions. All studies included had blinded and crossover experimental designs, and we conducted a risk-of-bias analysis. In total, we included 24 studies. A meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) estimated by Hedges g and 95% CIs. Caffeine ingestion increased high-intensity sport-specific actions during competition, such as the number of sprints (SMD: 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-0.74), body impacts (SMD: 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49), accelerations (SMD: 0.35; 95% CI, 0.06-0.63), decelerations (SMD: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.12-1.14), and high-intensity offensive efforts (SMD: 0.36; 95% CI, 0.11-0.61). Additionally, caffeine ingestion induced a higher positive or success rate of actions during real or simulated competition (SMD: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69). The current meta-analysis provides evidence of caffeine supplementation in increasing high-intensity efforts and the success rate of sport-specific actions during real or simulated competition.",

Nine resistance-trained men (mean \u00b1 SD: age, 24 \u00b1 2 years; weight, 84 \u00b1 8 kg; height, 180 \u00b1 8 cm) completed a squat and bench press exercise protocol at 60% 1 repetition maximum until failure on 5 occasions consuming 0.15 g\u00b7kg caffeinated coffee (COF), 0.15 g\u00b7kg decaffeinated coffee (DEC), 0.15 g\u00b7kg decaffeinated coffee plus 5 mg\u00b7kg anhydrous caffeine (D + C), 5 mg\u00b7kg anhydrous caffeine (CAF), or a placebo (PLA). Felt arousal and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were used to assess perceptual variables and heart rate (HR) to assess physiological responses between trials. There were significant differences in total weight lifted for the squat between conditions (p < 0.01; (Equation is included in full-text article.)= 0.54) with a greater amount lifted during D + C compared with DEC (p < 0.01), CAF (p \u2264 0.05), and PLA (p \u2264 0.05) conditions. Total weight lifted during the COF condition was significantly greater than that lifted under PLA (p < 0.01), although not significantly greater than the amount of weight lifted during the DEC condition (p = 0.082).

          "content": "This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of caffeine supplements on sleep parameters among professional athletes. A systematic search of randomized controlled trials (PROSPERO: CRD42024505377) was performed from 1980 to December 2023 through Web of Science (ISI), Cinahl, Embase, CENTRAL, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Scienceopen. The effect of caffeine supplement on all sleep parameters (e.g. duration, quality, insomnia), assessed through objective and subjective methods, was investigated among the athletic community. Of 1469 records, nine trials were eligible for the current review. The studies showed varying results concerning sleep quality, quantity, efficiency, number of awakenings, sleep onset latency, and other sleep-related variables. These differences in findings may be attributable to factors such as the timing of caffeine consumption in relation to sleep time and the time of exercise, habitual caffeine use, and the dose of caffeine prescribed. Given the nature of caffeine, insomnia following ingestion is likely to occur. This review explores the mechanisms by which caffeine influences sleep in athletes. While caffeine supplementation may enhance athletic performance, it could have a detrimental effect on sleep and therefore recovery. It is important that supplementation considers individual responses to caffeine so that it does not adversely affect sleep in this population. CRD42024505377.",

          "content": "Caffeine is the most widely ingested psychoactive drug in the world. As many know, chronic use of caffeine leads to dependence, tolerance, drug craving, and upon abrupt cessation unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Thus, caffeine fulfills pharmacological criteria by which agents are classified as drugs of abuse. Nevertheless, its use is legal and only at high, but readily attainable, levels is it banned from sport. Its use is widespread by athletes as young as 11 years of age who are seeking athletic advantage over fellow competitors. It is likely that its use will not decline any time soon because it is inexpensive, readily available, medically quite safe, socially acceptable, and by most measures legal. However, at levels allowed in sport, caffeine through its wide-ranging physiological and psychological effects increases endurance in well-trained athletes. If the goal of drug-testing and education programs in sport is to protect the health of athletes, prevent unfair advantage (cheating) and encourage ethical behavior then it seems obvious that the allowable levels of caffeine ingestion should be decreased. The alternative is to continue with policies designed largely to punish only those that get caught.",

Although the inter-individuals variability in the caffeine metabolism is known, the relation of caffeine metabolites with hypertension remains unsettled. We examined the association of caffeine and 13 direct and indirect caffeine metabolites with hypertension in U.S. adults. Using data from 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we included 2278 individuals aged 18 to 80 years. Urinary methyluric acids (MU) and methylxanthines (MX) products of caffeine metabolism were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. We used multivariate logistic regression to model hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265130\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u226580\u2009mmHg) as functions of urinary coffee metabolites. The odds of hypertension decreased across quartiles of 3-MU, 7-MU, 3-MX and 7-MX, with 7-MU being the more powerful metabolite. Compared with adults in the bottom quartile of 7-MU, the odds of hypertension decreased by 81% (95% CI: -90 to -22%) in those in the upper quartile. In contrast, the odds ratio for being hypertensive from the bottom to the upper quartile were 4.47 (95% CI: 1.21-16.50) for 1,3-dimethyluric acid, 4.45 (95% CI: 1.48-13.39) for 1,3-dimethylxanthine, and 5.08 (95% CI: 1.11-23.36) for 1,7-dimethylxanthine. Neither insulin resistance nor abdominal obesity were moderators in these associations. Final metabolites of caffeine (namely 3-MU, 7-MU, 3-MX and 7-MX), but not caffeine, significantly reduce the odds for hypertension in this population.",

          "content": "Athletes often use sport supplements to improve their physical and physiological performance. This randomized, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of combined versus single supplementation of creatine (Cr), beta-alanine (BA), and L-citrulline (L-Cit) during short sprint interval training (SSIT)\u00a0on basketball players' physical and physiological performance over a period of 28\u00a0days. Forty-eight basketball players were equally assigned to 6 groups of Cr (0.1\u00a0g/kg of Cr monohydrate daily), BA (4.8\u00a0g daily), L-Cit (6\u00a0g daily), combined supplementation, PL, and an active control group, and each group consisted of 8 participants. The training groups participated in SSIT (3 sets of 10 repetitions of 5-s all-out runs) sessions 3 times a week for 4\u00a0weeks. Physical (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Illinois change of direction) and physiological (Wingate anaerobic power and cardiorespiratory fitness test) performance were evaluated before and after the training period. All training groups (Cr, BA, L-Cit, combined, and PL) showed significant improvements in physical and physiological performance over the 4-week intervention (P < .05). Interestingly, the supplement groups displayed significantly (P = .001) greater changes than the PL group, indicating better outcomes in performance adaptations. However, significant differences in performance variables were observed among the supplement groups. Our findings indicate that short-term supplementation with Cr, BA, and L-Cit, as well as a combination of them during SSIT, can significantly improve the physical and physiological performance of basketball players compared to a PL.",

          "content": "Water polo (WP) is a high-intensity team sport that requires a combination of physical endurance, muscular strength, speed, and specific technical skills. Due to the demanding and prolonged nature of this sport, adequate and balanced nutrition plays a fundamental role in athletes' performance, recovery, and overall health maintenance. We aimed to compile all available information on the importance of ergonutrition and supplementation in the recovery of WP players. This will help in understanding this sport's specific challenges and requirements, enabling players and coaches to design more effective recovery plans to optimize performance, achieve goals, and successfully cope with intense training and competition. English-language publications were searched in databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO Citation Index, Medline (PubMed), KCI Korean Journal Database, and Current Contents Connect using a series of keywords such as WP, nutrition, recovery, and ergogenic aids individually or in combination. In the field of ergonutritional recovery in WP, certain supplements such as whey protein, beta-alanine, L-arginine, spirulina, and copper can be beneficial for improving performance and recovery. In some cases, WP athletes may consider using ergogenic supplements to further improve their performance and recovery process. However, it is important to bear in mind that any supplement should be carefully evaluated under the supervision of a health professional or a sports nutritionist, as some supplements may present side effects or unwanted interactions. Adequate ergogenic nutrition adapted to the needs of WP players is essential not only to optimize their athletic performance but also to ensure effective recovery and maintain their long-term health and general well-being. The application of these strategies should be evidence-based and tailored to the individual needs of the players and the specific demands of the sport. Future experimental research that can confirm our results is essential.",

          "content": "Warfighters, often called tactical athletes, seek dietary supplementation to enhance training and recovery. Roughly 69% of active-duty US military personnel have reported consuming dietary supplements. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the impact of dietary supplements on muscle-related physical performance and recovery in active-duty military personnel. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental controlled trials of oral dietary supplementation in active-duty military members were examined. A protocol was registered (PROSPERO CRD42023401472), and a systematic search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was undertaken. Inclusion criteria consisted of studies published between 1990-2023 with outcomes of muscle performance and recovery among active-duty military populations. The risk of bias was assessed with the McMaster University Guidelines and Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies. Sixteen studies were included. Four were conducted on protein or carbohydrate; four on beta-alanine alone, creatine alone, or in combination; two on mixed nutritional supplements; two on probiotics alone or in combination with beta hydroxy-beta methylbutyrate calcium; and four on phytonutrient extracts including oregano, beetroot juice, quercetin, and resveratrol. Ten examined outcomes related to physical performance, and six on outcomes of injury or recovery. Overall, protein, carbohydrate, beta-alanine, creatine, and beetroot juice modestly improved performance, while quercetin did not. Protein, carbohydrates, beta-alanine, probiotics, and oregano reduced markers of inflammation, while resveratrol did not. Nutrition supplementation may have small benefits on muscle performance and recovery in warfighters. However, there are significant limitations in interpretation due to the largely inconsistent evidence of ingredients and comparable outcomes. Thus, there is inadequate practical evidence to suggest how dietary supplementation may affect field performance.",

          "content": "Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation increases muscle carnosine, an abundant endogenous antioxidant and pH buffer in skeletal muscle. Carnosine loading promotes exercise capacity in healthy older adults. As patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suffer from elevated exercise-induced muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress and acidosis, and from reduced muscle carnosine stores, it was investigated whether BA supplementation augments muscle carnosine and induces beneficial changes in exercise capacity, quadriceps function, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress in patients with COPD. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo (PL)-controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02770417), 40 patients (75% male) with COPD (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation: age 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0years; FEV % predicted 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014%) were assigned to 12\u00a0weeks oral BA or PL supplementation (3.2\u00a0g/day). The primary outcome, i.e. muscle carnosine, was quantified from m. vastus lateralis biopsies obtained before and after intervention. Co-primary outcomes, i.e. incremental and constant work rate cycle capacity, were also assessed. Linear mixed model analyses were performed. Compliance with and side effects of supplement intake and secondary outcomes (quadriceps strength and endurance, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress) were also assessed. Beta-alanine supplementation increased muscle carnosine in comparison with PL in patients with COPD (mean difference [95% confidence interval]; +2.82 [1.49-4.14] mmol/kg wet weight; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Maximal incremental cycling capacity (VO peak: +0.5 [-0.7 to 1.7] mL/kg/min; P\u00a0=\u00a00.384, Wpeak: +5 [-1 to 11] W; P\u00a0=\u00a00.103) and time to exhaustion on the constant work rate cycle test (+28 [-179 to 236] s; P\u00a0=\u00a00.782) did not change significantly. Compliance with supplement intake was similar in BA (median (quartile 1-quartile 3); 100 (98-100)%) and PL (98 (96-100)%) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.294) groups, and patients did not report side effects possibly related to supplement intake. No change was observed in secondary outcomes. Beta-alanine supplementation is efficacious in augmenting muscle carnosine (+54% from mean baseline value) without side effects\u00a0in patients with COPD in comparison with PL. However, accompanied beneficial changes in exercise capacity, quadriceps function, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress were not observed.",

          "content": "Exercise intolerance is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and, although multifactorial, it is largely caused by lower-limb muscle dysfunction. Research has shown that patients with severe to very severe COPD have significantly lower levels of muscle carnosine, which acts as a pH buffer and antioxidant. Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation has been shown to consistently elevate muscle carnosine in a variety of populations and may therefore improve exercise tolerance and lower-limb muscle function. The primary objective of the current studies is to assess the beneficial effects of BA supplementation in enhancing exercise tolerance on top of two types of exercise training (non-linear periodised exercise (NLPE) training or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)) in patients with COPD. Two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have been designed. Patients will routinely receive either NLPE (BASE-TRAIN trial) or NMES (BASE-ELECTRIC trial) as part of standard exercise-based care during their 8-to-10 week pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme. A total of 222 patients with COPD (2\u00d777 = 154 patients in the BASE-TRAIN trial and 2\u00d734 = 68 patients in the BASE-ELECTRIC trial) will be recruited from two specialised PR centres in The Netherlands. For study purposes, patients will receive 3.2 g of oral BA supplementation or placebo per day. Exercise tolerance is the primary outcome, which will be assessed using the endurance shuttle walk test (BASE-TRAIN) or the constant work rate cycle test (BASE-ELECTRIC). Furthermore, quadriceps muscle strength and endurance, cognitive function, carnosine levels (in muscle), BA levels (in blood and muscle), markers of oxidative stress and inflammation (in blood, muscles and lungs), physical activity and quality of life will be measured. Both trials were approved by CMO Regio Arnhem-Nijmegen, The Netherlands (NL70781.091.19. and NL68757.091.19). NTR8427 (BASE-TRAIN) and NTR8419 (BASE-ELECTRIC).",

          "content": "Brisola, GMP and Zagatto, AM. Ergogenic effects of \u03b2-alanine supplementation on different sports modalities: strong evidence or only incipient findings? J Strength Cond Res 33(1): 253-282, 2019-\u03b2-Alanine supplementation is a popular nutritional ergogenic aid among the sports community. Due to its efficacy, already proven in the literature, to increase the intramuscular carnosine content (\u03b2-alanyl-L-histidine), whose main function is intramuscular buffering, \u03b2-alanine supplementation has become a nutritional strategy to improve performance, mainly in high-intensity efforts. However, although many studies present evidence of the efficacy of \u03b2-alanine supplementation in high-intensity efforts, discrepancies in outcomes are still present and the performance enhancing effects seem to be related to the specificities of each sport discipline, making it difficult for athletes/coaches to interpret the efficacy of \u03b2-alanine supplementation. Thus, this study carried out a review of the literature on this topic and summarized, analyzed, and critically discussed the findings with the objective of clarifying the current evidence found in the literature on different types of efforts and sport modalities. The present review revealed that inconsistencies are still found in aerobic parameters determined in incremental tests, except for physical working capacity at the neuromuscular fatigue threshold. Inconsistencies are also found for strength exercises and intermittent high-intensity efforts, whereas in supramaximal continuous mode intermittent exercise, the beneficial evidence is strong. In sports modalities, the evidence should be analyzed separately for each sporting modality. Thus, sports modalities that have strong evidence of the ergogenic effects of \u03b2-alanine supplementation are: cycling race of 4 km, rowing race of 2,000 m, swimming race of 100 and 200 m, combat modalities, and water polo. Finally, there is some evidence of slight additional effects on physical performance from cosupplementation with sodium bicarbonate.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of \u03b2-alanine supplementation on high-intensity running performance and critical velocity (CV) and anaerobic running capacity (ARC). Fifty recreationally trained men were randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to a \u03b2-alanine group (BA, 2 \u00d7 800 mg tablets, 3 times daily; CarnoSyn; n = 26) or placebo group (PL, 2 \u00d7 800 mg maltodextrin tablets, 3 times daily; n = 24). A graded exercise test (GXT) was performed to establish peak velocity (PV). Three high-speed runs to exhaustion were performed at 110, 100, and 90% of PV, with 15 minutes of rest between bouts. The distances achieved were plotted over the time to exhaustion (TTE). Linear regression was used to determine the slope (CV) and y-intercept (ARC) of these relationships to assess aerobic and anaerobic performances, respectively. There were no significant treatment effects (p > 0.05) on CV or ARC for either men or women. Additionally, no TTE effects were evident for bouts at 90-110%PV lasting 1.95-5.06 minutes.

          "content": "Increasing nitric oxide bioavailability may induce physiological effects that enhance endurance exercise performance. This review sought to evaluate the performance effects of consuming foods containing compounds that may promote nitric oxide bioavailability. Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, EMBASE and SportDiscus were searched, with included studies assessing endurance performance following consumption of foods containing nitrate, L-arginine, L-citrulline or polyphenols. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted, with subgroup analyses performed based on food sources, sex, fitness, performance test type and supplementation protocol (e.g. duration). One hundred and eighteen studies were included in the meta-analysis, which encompassed 59 polyphenol studies, 56 nitrate studies and three L-citrulline studies. No effect on exercise performance following consumption of foods rich in L-citrulline was identified (SMD=-0.03, p=0.24). Trivial but significant benefits were demonstrated for consumption of nitrate and polyphenol-rich foods (SMD=0.15 and 0.17, respectively, p<0.001), including performance in time-trial, time-to-exhaustion and intermittent-type tests, and following both acute and multiple-day supplementation, but no effect of nitrate or polyphenol consumption was found in females. Among nitrate-rich foods, beneficial effects were seen for beetroot, but not red spinach or Swiss chard and rhubarb. For polyphenol-rich foods, benefits were found for grape, (nitrate-depleted) beetroot, French maritime pine, Montmorency cherry and pomegranate, while no significant effects were evident for New Zealand blackcurrant, cocoa, ginseng, green tea or raisins. Considerable heterogeneity between polyphenol studies may reflect food-specific effects or differences in study designs and subject characteristics. Well-trained males (V\u0307O \u226565 ml.kg.min) exhibited small, significant benefits following polyphenol, but not nitrate consumption. Foods rich in polyphenols and nitrate provide trivial benefits for endurance exercise performance, although these effects may be food dependent. Highly trained endurance athletes do not appear to benefit from consuming nitrate-rich foods but may benefit from polyphenol consumption. Further research into food sources, dosage and supplementation duration to optimise the ergogenic response to polyphenol consumption is warranted. Further studies should evaluate whether differential sex-based responses to nitrate and polyphenol consumption are attributable to physiological differences or sample size limitations. The review protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/u7nsj ) and no funding was provided.",

          "content": "Athletes often use sport supplements to improve their physical and physiological performance. This randomized, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of combined versus single supplementation of creatine (Cr), beta-alanine (BA), and L-citrulline (L-Cit) during short sprint interval training (SSIT)\u00a0on basketball players' physical and physiological performance over a period of 28\u00a0days. Forty-eight basketball players were equally assigned to 6 groups of Cr (0.1\u00a0g/kg of Cr monohydrate daily), BA (4.8\u00a0g daily), L-Cit (6\u00a0g daily), combined supplementation, PL, and an active control group, and each group consisted of 8 participants. The training groups participated in SSIT (3 sets of 10 repetitions of 5-s all-out runs) sessions 3 times a week for 4\u00a0weeks. Physical (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Illinois change of direction) and physiological (Wingate anaerobic power and cardiorespiratory fitness test) performance were evaluated before and after the training period. All training groups (Cr, BA, L-Cit, combined, and PL) showed significant improvements in physical and physiological performance over the 4-week intervention (P < .05). Interestingly, the supplement groups displayed significantly (P = .001) greater changes than the PL group, indicating better outcomes in performance adaptations. However, significant differences in performance variables were observed among the supplement groups. Our findings indicate that short-term supplementation with Cr, BA, and L-Cit, as well as a combination of them during SSIT, can significantly improve the physical and physiological performance of basketball players compared to a PL.",

          "content": "Citrulline malate (CitMal) is a dietary supplement that is suggested to enhance strength training performance. However, there is conflicting evidence on this matter. Thus, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine whether supplementing with CitMal prior to strength training could increase the total number of repetitions performed before reaching voluntary muscular failure. A systematic search was conducted wherein the inclusion criteria were double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in healthy participants that examined the effect of CitMal on repetitions to failure during upper body and lower body resistance exercises. The Hedges's g standardized mean differences (SMD) between the placebo and CitMal trials were calculated and used in a random effect model. Two separate subanalyses were performed for upper body and lower body exercises. Eight studies, including 137 participants who consisted of strength-trained men (n = 101) and women (n = 26) in addition to untrained men (n = 9), fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Across the studies, 14 single-joint and multijoint exercises were performed with an average of 51 \u00b1 23 total repetitions during 5 \u00b1 3 sets per exercise at \u223c70% of one-repetition maximum. Supplementing with 6-8 g of CitMal 40-60\u00a0min before exercise increased repetitions by 3 \u00b1 5 (6.4 \u00b1 7.9%) compared with placebo (p = .022) with a small SMD (0.196). The subanalysis for the lower body resulted in a tendency for an effect of the supplement (8.1 \u00b1 8.4%, SMD: 0.27, p = .051) with no significant effect for the upper body (5.7 \u00b1 8.4%, SMD: 0.16, p = .131). The current analysis observed a small ergogenic effect of CitMal compared with placebo. Acute CitMal supplementation may, therefore, delay fatigue and enhance muscle endurance during high-intensity strength training.",

          "title": "Dietary Arginine and Citrulline Supplements for Cardiovascular Health and Athletic Performance: A Narrative Review.",
          "content": "The global market for nutritional supplements (NS) is growing rapidly, and the use of L-arginine (Arg), L-citrulline (Cit), and citrulline malate (CitMal) supplements has been shown to enhance cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Over the past decade, Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements have received considerable attention from researchers in the field of exercise nutrition, who have investigated their potential effects on hemodynamic function, endothelial function, aerobic and anaerobic capacity, strength, power, and endurance. Previous studies were reviewed to determine the potential impact of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and exercise performance. By synthesizing the existing literature, the study aimed to provide insight into the possible uses and limitations of these supplements for these purposes. The results showed that both recreational and trained athletes did not see improved physical performance or increased nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with 0.075 g or 6 g doses of Arg supplement per body weight. However, 2.4 to 6 g of Cit per day for 7 to 16 days of various NSs had a positive impact, increasing NO synthesis, enhancing athletic performance indicators, and reducing feelings of exertion. The effects of an 8 g acute dose of CitMal supplement were inconsistent, and more research is needed to determine its impact on muscle endurance performance. Based on the positive effects reported in previous studies, further testing is warranted in various populations that may benefit from nutritional supplements, including aerobic and anaerobic athletes, resistance-trained individuals, elderly people, and clinical populations, to determine the impact of different doses, timing of ingestion, and long-term and acute effects of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and athletic performance.",

This study aimed to examine the effects of a four-week supplementation protocol combining 500 mg of NO from amaranth extract and 8 g of CM (NIT + CM) on external training load and post-match recovery in professional female soccer players during pre-season. : A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 34 female soccer players who received either the NIT + CM product or a placebo for four weeks during pre-season. Global positioning system (GPS)-derived external load was recorded throughout the intervention. Performance tests-a countermovement jump (CMJ) test and the Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT)-and blood sampling for plasma NO and nitrite (NO) concentrations were conducted at baseline and the day after a competitive match. : The supplementation with NIT + CM increased maximal speed (Vmax) throughout training and match play. During post-match testing, the NIT + CM group exhibited a significantly smaller decline in mean (P) and minimum (P) power during the WAnT, along with reduced power loss in both the first (0-15 s) and second (15-30 s) intervals. Plasma NO concentrations significantly increased from baseline in the NIT + CM group and remained elevated 24 h after the final dose, confirming sustained systemic exposure. : Chronic NIT + CM supplementation may enhance Vmax and help preserve anaerobic performance the day after a match. These effects could reflect improved tolerance to high training loads and sustained NO availability during recovery.",

          "content": "The aim of this study was to explore the isolated and combined effects of caffeine and citrulline malate (CitMal) on jumping performance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and pain perception in resistance-trained participants. Using a randomized and double-blind study design, 35 resistance-trained males (n\u2009=\u200918) and females (n\u2009=\u200917) completed four testing sessions following the ingestion of isolated caffeine (5\u00a0mg/kg), isolated CitMal (12\u00a0g), combined doses of caffeine and CitMal, and placebo. Supplements were ingested 60\u00a0min before performing a countermovement jump (CMJ) test (outcomes included jump height, rate of force development, peak force, and peak power), one-repetition maximum (1RM) squat and bench press, and repetitions to muscular failure in the squat and bench press with 60% of 1RM. Pain perception was evaluated following the repetitions to failure tests. The study was registered at ISRCTN (registration number: ISRCTN11694009). Compared to the placebo condition, isolated caffeine ingestion and co-ingestion of caffeine and CitMal significantly enhanced strength in 1RM bench press (Cohen's d: 0.05-0.06; 2.5-2.7%), muscular endurance in the squat (d: 0.46-0.58; 18.6-18.7%) and bench press (d: 0.48-0.64; 9.3-9.5%). However, there was no significant difference between isolated caffeine ingestion and caffeine co-ingested with CitMal, and isolated CitMal supplementation did not have an ergogenic effect in any outcome. No main effect of condition was found in the analysis for CMJ-derived variables, 1RM squat and pain perception. Caffeine ingestion appears to be ergogenic for muscular strength and muscular endurance, while adding CitMal does not seem to further enhance these effects.",

          "content": "Gonzalez, AM and Trexler, ET. Effects of citrulline supplementation on exercise performance in humans: A review of the current literature. J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1480-1495, 2020-L-citrulline, a nonessential amino acid found primarily in watermelon, has recently garnered much attention for its potential to augment L-arginine bioavailability, nitric oxide production, and exercise performance. Over the past decade, L-citrulline has received considerable scientific attention examining potentially ergogenic properties for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance. Thus, the purpose of this article is to summarize the theoretical rationale behind L-citrulline supplementation and to comprehensively review the available scientific evidence assessing the potential ergogenic value of L-citrulline supplementation on vascular function and exercise performance in humans. In addition, research that has investigated the potential synergistic effects of L-citrulline with other dietary ingredients (e.g., arginine, antioxidants, nitrates, and branched-chain amino acids) is reviewed. Oral L-citrulline and citrulline malate supplementation have shown to increase plasma citrulline and arginine concentrations, along with total nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Although blood flow enhancement is a proposed mechanism for the ergogenic potential of L-citrulline, evidence supporting acute improvements in vasodilation and skeletal muscle tissue perfusion after supplementation is scarce and inconsistent. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that L-citrulline supplementation can enhance exercise performance and recovery. Given the positive effects observed from some investigations, future studies should continue to investigate the effects of both acute and chronic supplementation with L-citrulline and citrulline malate on markers of blood flow and exercise performance and should seek to elucidate the mechanism underlying such effects.",

          "content": "Oral L-citrulline (Cit) increases plasma L-arginine (Arg) concentration and the production of nitric oxide (NO). NO dilates blood vessels and potentially improves sports performance. The combination of oral Arg and Cit (Arg\u2009+\u2009Cit) immediately and synergistically increases plasma Arg and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) concentrations more than either Cit or Arg alone. This prompted us to assess the effects of oral Arg\u2009+\u2009Cit on 10-min cycling performance in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Twenty-four male soccer players ingested either Cit\u2009+\u2009Arg or placebo (both 1.2\u00a0g/day each) for 6\u00a0days. On day 7, they ingested Cit\u2009+\u2009Arg 1\u00a0h before performing a 10-min full-power pedaling test on a bicycle ergometer. Plasma NOx and amino acid levels were measured before and after the test, as well as the participants' subjective perception of physical exertion. Power output was significantly greater with Cit\u2009+\u2009Arg than in the placebo group (242\u2009\u00b1\u200924 vs. 231\u2009\u00b1\u200921\u00a0W; p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Cit\u2009+\u2009Arg also gave improved post-exercise subjective perception of \"leg muscle soreness\" and \"ease of pedaling\" (both p\u2009<\u20090.05).

          "content": "Citrulline is a popular dietary supplement, primarily thought to exert ergogenic effects on exercise performance through the enhancement of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and ammonia buffering. However, recent findings surrounding citrulline's effect on endurance performance have been inconsistent. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature have yet to be undertaken. To determine if acute ingestion of citrulline has an ergogenic effect on endurance performance in young healthy adults. A systematic search of three databases was undertaken to find peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English investigating the effects of citrulline supplementation on endurance performance in young healthy adults. Two independent investigators completed a three-phased screening procedure against pre-determined eligibility criteria. Included studies evaluated loading or bolus dosage regimes of citrulline in participants aged 18 or over that were at least recreationally active. Outcome measures focused on time-to-completion (TTC) or time-to-exhaustion (TTE) in continuous submaximal intensity exercise. Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed-effects model to pool the weighted estimate of standardized mean differences (SMD) across studies. A chi-squared test assessed heterogeneity between studies. This review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Nine studies (\u2009=\u2009158 participants) met the eligibility criteria; five reported TTE outcomes (I\u2009=\u20090%, \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.37, df\u2009=\u20094, \u2009=\u20090.99) and four reported TTC outcomes (I\u2009=\u20090%, \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.46, df\u2009=\u20093, \u2009=\u20090.93), both with a low between-study heterogeneity. The results of the meta-analyses showed no significant difference in the endurance performance measures, TTE (pooled SMD\u2009=\u20090.03 [-0.27, 0.33]) and TTC (pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.07 [-0.50, 0.15]), after acute ingestion of citrulline supplementation or a control in young healthy adults. The current evidence suggests no significant benefit of citrulline supplementation for endurance performance. However, the small evidence base requires further research to fully evaluate this topic. Recommendations include a focus on female populations; higher continuous doses of citrulline over seven days; and TTC outcome measures over longer distances to simulate competition.",

          "content": "Use of supplements to aid performance is common practice amongst recreationally active individuals, including those without a sufficient evidence base. This investigation sought to assess whether acute supplementation with 8\u00a0g of citrulline malate (CM) (1.11: 1 ratio) would improve anaerobic performance. A randomised double blind placebo control trial was employed, using a counterbalanced design. We recruited recreationally active men and women to take part in an isokinetic chair protocol, based on German Volume Training (GVT) whereby participants attempted to perform 10 sets of 10 repetitions against a force representing 70% of their peak concentric force. The number of repetitions achieved over the course of the GVT was 94.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 and 90.9\u2009\u00b1\u200913.9 for placebo and CM respectively. There was no significant difference between the placebo and CM treatment for number of repetitions (P\u2009=\u20090.33), isometric (P\u2009=\u20090.60), concentric (P\u2009=\u20090.38), or eccentric (P\u2009=\u20090.65) peak force following the GVT. Total muscle soreness was significantly higher in the CM compared to the placebo treatment following the GVT protocol over 72\u00a0h (P\u2009=\u20090.01); although this was not accompanied by a greater workload/number of repetitions in the CM group. We conclude that an acute dose of CM does not significantly affect anaerobic performance using an isokinetic chair in recreational active participants. Practical implications include precaution in recommending CM supplementation. Coaches and athletes should be aware of the disparity between the chemical analyses of the products reviewed in the present investigation versus the manufacturers' claims.",

J Strength Cond Res 36(12): 3562-3570, 2022-This systematic review examines the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation (SUP) on muscle strength and hypertrophy when combined with physical exercise. The databases PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE were searched for full-text articles published between January 2000 and June 2020. For inclusion, studies had to report on the effects of SUP administered as acute or chronic doses together with a standardized exercise protocol on muscle strength and hypertrophy compared with placebo in healthy adults who were sedentary, physically active, or professional athletes. Twelve studies (1,571 subjects) were finally selected. In 5 studies, the SUP regime was acute, and in 7, it was chronic. SUP was nitrate-rich beetroot juice in 9 studies, a potassium nitrate capsule in 1, and increased dietary nitrate in 2. Ingested nitrate was 64-1,200 mg. Of the 12 studies, 6 observed an ergogenic effect of SUP compared with placebo. These findings indicate that muscle strength gains are possible provided the dose, format, frequency, period, and exercise test are appropriate. Best results were observed with a minimum acute dose of 400 mg of nitrate provided as beetroot juice/shot taken 2-2.5 hours before exercise involving low- and high-intensity muscle contractions. This SUP regime seems to improve muscle efficiency in terms of reduced phosphocreatine and energy costs (P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and improved time to exhaustion.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the influence of dietary nitrate supplementation on performance metrics during cycling sprint exercise according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted on MEDLINE, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases up to September 2023. Inclusion criteria were healthy recreationally active men and women who consumed nitrate-rich and nitrate-deficient beetroot juice to assess performance outcomes of mean power, peak power, time-to-peak power, and minimum power during 30-s cycling sprints. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 and TESTEX tools and funnel plots. A random effects model was performed on six studies and showed that dietary nitrate had significant effects on time-to-peak power (SMD: -0.66, 95% CI: -1.127 to -0.192,  = 0.006) but not on mean power, peak power, or minimum power. Subgroup analysis revealed that an acute low nitrate dose improved time-to-peak power (SMD: -0.977, 95% CI: -1.524 to -0.430,  < 0.001) but not after a multiday moderate nitrate dose (SMD: -0.177, 95% CI: -0.619 to -0.264,  = 0.431). These data suggest that acute nitrate supplementation can benefit time-to-peak power during 30-s cycling sprints, but due to the limited availability of data and heterogeneity in methodology, these results should be interpreted with caution. There was insufficient data on women to analyze sex-based differences. Future studies are required to provide insight on how supplementation regimen and population impact the effects of dietary nitrate for enhancing cycling sprint performance.",

We hypothesised that these effects might be sufficient to improve exercise performance in patients with COPD and hypoxia severe enough to require supplemental oxygen. We conducted a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, enrolling adults with COPD who were established users of long-term oxygen therapy. Participants performed an endurance shuttle walk test, using their prescribed oxygen, 3\u2009hours after consuming either 140\u2009mL of nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BRJ) (12.9\u2009mmol nitrate) or placebo (nitrate-depleted BRJ). Treatment order was allocated (1:1) by computer-generated block randomisation. The primary outcome was endurance shuttle walk test time. The secondary outcomes included area under the curve to isotime for fingertip oxygen saturation and heart rate parameters during the test, blood pressure, and endothelial function assessed using flow-mediated dilatation. Plasma nitrate and nitrite levels as well as FE were also measured. 20 participants were recruited and all completed the study. Nitrate-rich BRJ supplementation prolonged exercise endurance time in all participants as compared with placebo: median (IQR) 194.6 (147.5-411.7) s vs 159.1 (121.9-298.5) s, estimated treatment effect 62 (33-106)\u2009s (p<0.0001).

          "content": "Menopause is linked to reduced estrogen and nitric oxide (NO) production, which may contribute to declines in muscle function and quality of life. Acute dietary nitrate intake from beetroot has been shown to improve NO bioavailability and muscle function in older. However, the effects of prolonged dietary nitrate supplementation (i.e., longer than two weeks) remain unexplored. This study investigated the effects of four and eight weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation on muscle contractile properties and nitrate tolerance in postmenopausal women. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel study. Participants received daily 20\u00a0g of nitrate-rich beetroot extract (BET, containing \u223c548\u00a0mg/8.8\u00a0mmol nitrate) or nitrate-depleted beetroot extract (PLA, containing \u223c43\u00a0mg/0.7\u00a0mmol nitrate) for eight weeks. Outcomes, including circulating nitrate and nitrite levels and muscle contractile properties, were assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 8. Twenty-two participants completed the study. Fasting nitrate and nitrite levels were significantly higher in the BET group than in the PLA group-nitrate at week 4 and both nitrate and nitrite at week 8. At week 8, maximal knee extensor torque (F) was significantly greater in the BET group compared to PLA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), while no changes were seen for maximal power (P) or velocity (V). Peak torque and power improved at week 8, especially at angular velocities of 60\u00b0\u00b7s and 90\u00b0\u00b7s for torque, and at 90\u00b0\u00b7s, 180\u00b0\u00b7s, and 270\u00b0\u00b7s for power. This study demonstrated that eight weeks of nitrate-rich beetroot extract increases fasting nitrate and nitrite levels, enhancing muscle strength and power in postmenopausal women.",

          "content": "The purpose of this review was to examine the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance by systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled human studies. A search of four electronic databases and cross-referencing found 17 studies investigating the effect of inorganic nitrate supplementation on exercise performance that met the inclusion criteria. Beetroot juice and sodium nitrate were the most common supplements, with doses ranging from 300 to 600 mg nitrate and prescribed in a manner ranging from a single bolus to 15 days of regular ingestion. Pooled analysis showed a significant moderate benefit (ES = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.23-1.35) of nitrate supplementation on performance for time to exhaustion tests (p = .006). There was a small but insignificant beneficial effect on performance for time trials (ES = 0.11, 95% CI: -0.16-0.37) and graded exercise tests (ES = 0.26, 95% CI: -0.10-0.62). Qualitative analysis suggested that performance benefits are more often observed in inactive to recreationally active individuals and when a chronic loading of nitrate over several days is undertaken. Overall, these results suggest that nitrate supplementation is associated with a moderate improvement in constant load time to exhaustion tasks. Despite not reaching statistical significance, the small positive effect on time trial or graded exercise performance may be meaningful in an elite sport context. More data are required to clarify the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance and to elucidate the optimal way to implement supplementation.",

          "content": "Oral inorganic nitrate (NO) supplementation has been shown to increase bioavailable NO and provide potential ergogenic benefits in males; however, data in females is scarce. Estrogen is known to increase endogenous NO bioavailability and to fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle (MC), being lowest in the early follicular (EF) phase and highest during the late follicular (LF) phase. This study examined the effects of oral NO supplementation on exercise economy, endurance capacity, and vascular health in young females across the MC. Ten normally menstruating females' MCs were tested in a double-blinded, randomized design during both the EF and LF phases of the MC. Participants consumed \u223c13 mmol NO, in the form of 140 mL beetroot juice (BRJ) or an identical NO-depleted placebo (PL) for \u223c3 days before lab visits and 2 h before testing on lab visits. Plasma nitrate, nitrite, and estradiol were assessed, as was blood pressure and pulse wave velocity. Moderate-intensity exercise economy and severe intensity time to exhaustion (TTE) were tested on a cycle ergometer. As expected, plasma estradiol was elevated in the LF phase, and plasma nitrite and nitrate were elevated in the BRJ condition. Exercise economy was unaltered by BRJ or the MC, however TTE was significantly worsened by 48 s (\u223c10%) after BRJ supplementation ( = 0.04), but was not different across the MC with no interaction effects. In conclusion, NO supplementation did not affect exercise economy or vascular health and worsened aerobic endurance capacity (TTE), suggesting healthy females should proceed with caution when considering supplementation with BRJ. Although inorganic nitrate (NO) supplementation has increased in popularity as a means of improving exercise performance, data in females at different phases of the menstrual cycle are lacking despite known interactions of estrogen with NO. This study revealed neither NO supplementation nor the menstrual cycle influenced exercise economy or vascular health in healthy young naturally menstruating females, while NO supplementation significantly worsened endurance capacity (10%) independent of the menstrual cycle phase.",

          "content": "Dietary nitrate supplementation has been shown to decrease the oxygen cost of exercise and prolong exercise tolerance, as measured by sub-maximal exercise endurance distance and time at 85% V\u0307O2max, in both elite athletes and normal healthy subjects. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have reduced quality of life and ability to perform activities of daily living attributable to diminished exercise tolerance, and dietary nitrate may be able to ameliorate this. We performed a double-blind, computer-randomized placebo control crossover trial at a tertiary Australian hospital to investigate whether dietary nitrate supplementation as beetroot juice (BR) would augment submaximal exercise endurance in individuals with spirometrically confirmed stable moderate COPD. Volunteers underwent an incremental shuttle walk test to determine V\u0307O2max followed by a test dose of BR to establish safety in the study population. Participants performed an endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) at 85% V\u0307O2max after randomization to either a 3 day wash-in of BR (4.8 mmol twice a day) or placebo (nitrate deplete BR), with a final dose on the morning of testing. They then crossed over after 4 day washout. Repeated measures two sided paired t-tests were employed. 35 participants were recruited with 19 completing the trial. In the initial safety phase, we measured systolic blood pressure over four hours post first dose of BR, and found a mean 10 mmHg decrement maximal at 1 hour. One individual developed symptomatic postural hypotension and was excluded. The primary outcomes of ESWT distance and time to fatigue improved by 11% and 6% respectively; however these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.494 and 0.693 respectively).

However, nitrate may exacerbate acute mountain sickness (AMS), specifically headache. This study investigated the effect of nitrate supplementation on AMS symptoms and exercise responses with 6-h hypoxia. Twenty recreationally active men [age, 22 \u00b1 4 yr, maximal oxygen consumption (V\u0307o), 51 \u00b1 6 ml\u00b7min\u00b7kg, means \u00b1 SD] completed this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study. Twelve participants were classified as AMS- on the basis of Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire [Acute Cerebral Mountain Sickness score (AMS-C)] <0.7 in both trials, and five participants were classified as AMS+ on the basis of AMS-C \u22650.7 on placebo. Five days of nitrate supplementation (70-ml beetroot juice containing ~6.4 mmol nitrate daily) increased plasma NO metabolites by 182 \u00b5M compared with placebo but did not reduce AMS or improve exercise performance. After 4-h hypoxia [inspired O fraction ([Formula: see text])\u2009=\u20090.124], nitrate increased AMS-C and headache severity (visual analog scale; whole sample \u220610 [1, 20] mm, mean difference [95% confidence interval];  = 0.03) compared with placebo. In addition, after 5-h hypoxia, nitrate increased sense of effort during submaximal exercise (\u22067 [-1, 14];  = 0.07). In AMS-, nitrate did not alter headache or sense of effort. In contrast, in AMS+, nitrate increased headache severity (\u220626 [-3, 56] mm;  = 0.07), sense of effort (\u220614 [1, 28];  = 0.04), oxygen consumption, ventilation, and mean arterial pressure during submaximal exercise. On the next day, in a separate acute hypoxic exercise test ([Formula: see text]\u2009=\u20090.141), nitrate did not improve time to exhaustion at 80% hypoxic V\u0307o In conclusion, dietary nitrate increases AMS and sense of effort during exercise, particularly in those who experience AMS. Dietary nitrate is therefore not recommended as an AMS prophylactic or ergogenic aid in nonacclimatized individuals at altitude. This is the first study to identify that the popular dietary nitrate supplement (beetroot) does not reduce acute mountain sickness (AMS) or improve exercise performance during 6-h hypoxia. The consumption of nitrate in those susceptible to AMS exacerbates AMS symptoms (headache) and sense of effort and raises oxygen cost, ventilation, and blood pressure during walking exercise in 6-h hypoxia. These data question the suitability of nitrate supplementation during altitude travel in nonacclimatized people.",

Eleven recreationally active male participants (27\u2009\u00b1\u20095 yr, V\u0307o: 42\u2009\u00b1\u20092 mL/kg/min) performed two experimental trials following 3 days of either dietary nitrate-rich beetroot juice (4.1 mmol NO/day; DNS) or placebo (PLA) supplementation in a blinded, counterbalanced order. Exercise consisted of constant-load cycling at 50, 75, and 100 W (4 min each) and, at \u223c80% of peak power output (218\u2009\u00b1\u200912 W), to task-failure. All participants returned to repeat the shorter of the two trials performed to task failure, but with the opposite supplementation regime (iso-time comparison; ISO). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), leg blood flow (Q; Doppler ultrasound), leg vascular conductance (LVC), and pulmonary gas exchange were continuously assessed during exercise. Locomotor muscle fatigue was determined by the change in pre to postexercise quadriceps twitch-torque (\u0394Q) and voluntary activation (\u0394VA; electrical femoral nerve stimulation). Following DNS, plasma [nitrite] (\u223c670 vs. \u223c180 nmol) and [nitrate] (\u223c775 vs. \u223c11 \u03bcmol) were significantly elevated compared with PLA. Unlike PLA, DNS lowered both Q and MAP by \u223c8% ( < 0.05), but did not alter LVC ( = 0.31). V\u0307O across work rates, as well as cycling time to task-failure (\u223c7 min) and locomotor muscle fatigue following the ISO-time comparison were not different between the two conditions (\u0394Q \u223c42%, \u0394VA \u223c4%). Thus, despite significant hemodynamic changes, DNS did not alter the development of locomotor muscle fatigue and, ultimately, cycling time to task failure. This study sought to characterize the impact of dietary nitrate supplementation on the hemodynamic response, locomotor muscle fatigue, and time to task failure during cycling exercise. Although nitrate supplementation lowered mean arterial pressure and exercising leg blood flow, leg vascular conductance and oxygen utilization were unaffected. Despite significant hemodynamic changes, there was no effect of dietary nitrate on neuromuscular fatigue development and, ultimately, cycling time to task failure.",

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) were an experimental trial published in an English peer-reviewed journal; (b) compared the effects of inorganic nitrate consumption with a non-bioactive supplement control or placebo; (c) used a quantifiable measure of exercise performance; and (d) was carried out in apparently healthy participants without disease. A total of 29 studies were identified that investigated the effects of nitrate supplementation on exercise tolerance or performance in accordance with the criteria outlined. Analysis using time to exhaustion as the outcome variable revealed a significant effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise tolerance (ES = 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.47; p = 0.006) compared with placebo. Analysis using time to complete a specific distance as the outcome variable revealed no significant effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance (ES = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.28 to 0.17; p = 0.64) compared with placebo. Nitrate supplementation is likely to improve exercise tolerance and capacity that may improve exercise performance. More research is required to determine the optimal dose and duration of nitrate supplementation. It would also be important to consider the type of athlete performing the exercise and the duration, intensity, and mode of the exercise performed because these factors are likely to influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation.",

The present data indicate that [Formula: see text] supplementation does not significantly affect knee extensor maximal power, maximal contraction velocity, and muscular endurance in either sex. The sex-dependent response to dietary nitrate supplementation requires further investigation as data on females is scarce. Recent data have suggested that inorganic nitrate ([Formula: see text]) supplementation may benefit males; however, females may experience worsened endurance capacity. This study revealed a potential differentiated effect of [Formula: see text] supplementation on outcomes of muscle contractile function between healthy, young males and females. The specific responses of [Formula: see text] supplementation in females and across sexes remain understudied and require further investigation.",

          "content": "Oral inorganic nitrate ([Formula: see text]) supplementation increases nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and may improve muscular power in males and females, although data in females are limited. Estrogen increases NO bioavailability and fluctuates throughout the menstrual cycle, with low levels in the early follicular (EF) phase and peaking during the late follicular (LF) phase. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of [Formula: see text] supplementation on isokinetic peak power, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) force, muscular endurance, and recovery from fatigue in healthy young females during the EF and LF phases of the menstrual cycle. Ten eumenorrheic females were tested in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled design. Participants consumed \u223c13 mmol [Formula: see text], in the form of 140 mL beetroot juice (BRJ), or an identical [Formula: see text]-depleted placebo (PL), for \u223c5 days prior to visits and 2 h prior to testing. Plasma estradiol was elevated in the LF phase, and plasma nitrite and nitrate were elevated in the BRJ condition ( < 0.05). Although isokinetic peak power was unchanged, calculated maximal power (Pmax) and maximal velocity (Vmax) were significantly worsened in the BRJ treatment independent of the menstrual cycle phase ( = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). Muscular endurance, MVIC, and fatigue recovery were unaltered by BRJ or the menstrual cycle. These data indicate that [Formula: see text] supplementation decreased maximal power and velocity in females and suggest that the benefits of [Formula: see text] supplementation previously found in males may not extend to young females. Recent data have suggested that inorganic nitrate ([Formula: see text]) supplementation may benefit males, however, females may experience worsened endurance capacity independent of menstrual cycle phase. This study revealed neither [Formula: see text] supplementation nor the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle influenced maximal isometric voluntary contraction or endurance capacity in healthy, young, naturally menstruating females, whereas [Formula: see text] supplementation significantly worsened estimated peak power (Pmax) and velocity (Vmax) independent of the menstrual cycle phase.",

These comorbidities may prevent early recovery after surgery. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of oral nutritional formula-enriched \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methyl-butyrate (HMB), a leucine metabolite that promotes muscle synthesis and suppresses proteolysis, on postoperative sarcopenia and other outcomes after adult-to-adult living donor LT (LDLT). Thirty-three consecutive patients who underwent adult LDLT between March 2017 and October 2018 and who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the HMB or control group. Patients in the HMB group received two packs of HMB-rich nutrients per day, which contained calcium-HMB (1500 mg), l-arginine (7000 mg), and l -glutamine (7000 mg) per pack orally or enterally from postoperative day 1 to 30 with postoperative rehabilitation. The primary endpoint was grip strength (GS) at 2 mo after LDLT. Secondary endpoints included GS at 1 mo after LDLT, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) at 1 and 2 mo after LDLT, laboratory findings, incidence of postoperative bacteremia, and postoperative hospital length of stay (LOS). Twelve patients in the HMB group and 11 in the control group were included in the final analysis. GS at 1 and 2 mo and SMI values at 2 mo were significantly higher in the HMB group than in the control group (GS: both P < 0.001, SMI: P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). In the HMB group, white blood cell count 3 wk after LDLT was significantly lower (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and postoperative hospital LOS was significantly shorter (P\u00a0=\u00a00.028) compared with the control group. The incidence of postoperative bacteremia was lower in the HMB group. Postoperative administration of HMB-enriched formula with rehabilitation significantly increased GS at 1 and 2 mo and SMI at 2 mo and shortened postoperative hospital LOS after LDLT.",

No long-term studies utilizing HMB free acid (HMB-FA) have been conducted. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 12 weeks of HMB-FA supplementation on skeletal muscle hypertrophy, body composition, strength, and power in trained individuals. We also determined the effects of HMB-FA on muscle damage and performance during an overreaching cycle. A three-phase double-blind, placebo- and diet-controlled randomized intervention study was conducted. Phase 1 was an 8-week-periodized resistance-training program; Phase 2 was a 2-week overreaching cycle; and Phase 3 was a 2-week taper. Muscle mass, strength, and power were examined at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 to assess the chronic effects of HMB-FA; and assessment of these, as well as cortisol, testosterone, and creatine kinase (CK) was performed at weeks 9 and 10 of the overreaching cycle. HMB-FA resulted in increased total strength (bench press, squat, and deadlift combined) over the 12-week training (77.1 \u00b1 18.4 vs. 25.3 \u00b1 22.0 kg, p < 0.001); a greater increase in vertical jump power (991 \u00b1 168 vs. 630 \u00b1 167 W, p < 0.001); and increased lean body mass gain (7.4 \u00b1 4.2 vs. 2.1 \u00b1 6.1 kg, p < 0.001) in HMB-FA- and placebo-supplemented groups, respectively. During the overreaching cycle, HMB-FA attenuated increases in CK (-6 \u00b1 91 vs. 277 \u00b1 229 IU/l, p < 0.001) and cortisol (-0.2 \u00b1 2.9 vs. 4.5 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcg/dl, p < 0.003) in the HMB-FA- and placebo-supplemented groups, respectively. These results suggest that HMB-FA enhances hypertrophy, strength, and power following chronic resistance training, and prevents decrements in performance following the overreaching.",

          "content": "Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, is currently widely used in athletes to increase muscle mass and strength and has also been used as a nutritional supplement in recent years to maintain muscle mass in muscular atrophic diseases of older people. However, the effects of HMB supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function in older people remain controversial. The purpose of this review was to explore the effects of HMB on body composition in older adults. The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to obtain the randomized controlled trials needed as a basis for systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of 9 studies (448 participants) were eventually found eligible. The pooled results showed that HMB supplementation significantly increased fat-free mass in older people compared with the control group (effect size: 0.37; 95% Cl 0.16, 0.58; Z value\u2009=\u20093.47, P\u2009=\u20090.001; Fixed-effect model).

Subgroup analysis of HMB supplementation alone showed a significant improvement in fat-free mass in older people (effect size: 0.59; 95% CI 0.32, 0.87; Z\u2009=\u20094.24, P\u2009<\u20090.001; fixed-effect model), whereas HMB supplementation combined with exercise intervention showed no additional fat-free mass change (effect size: 0.06; 95% CI -\u00a00.26, 0.38; Z\u2009=\u20090.38, P\u2009=\u20090.705; Fixed-effect model). HMB supplementation is beneficial for improving body composition in older people. However, the effect of HMB supplementation combined with exercise therapy to improve muscle mass is not obvious. Exercise programs need to be designed according to the different physical health of older people.",

J Strength Cond Res 36(2): 585-592, 2022-The purpose of this article was to systematically review and meta-analyze the current literature to determine the effects of HMB on body composition in athletes. Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) were an experimental design published in a peer-reviewed, English-language journal; (b) included human athletic populations; (c) assessed body mass (BM), fat mass (FM), or fat-free mass (FFM) using a validated measure; (d) and had a minimum supplementation period of 4 weeks. Separate analyses were performed for BM, FM, and FFM using robust variance random-effects meta-regression for multilevel data structures, with adjustments for small samples. The final analysis of BM comprised a total of 208 subjects from 7 studies. Analysis of FFM and FM encompassed 5 studies comprising 161 subjects and 5 studies comprising 128 subjects, respectively. The principal finding of this analysis suggests HMB may have a small, positive impact on FFM in athletes (0.30 \u00b1 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.07 to 0.68; p = 0.08), although this seems specific to when protein intake is suboptimal (<1.6 g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1). Consistent with previous research on athletes, HMB demonstrated no significant effect on BM (-0.02 \u00b1 0.04; 95% CI: -0.14 to 0.10; p = 0.70) and a small, nonsignificant effect on FM (-0.33 \u00b1 0.23; 95% CI: -0.96 to 0.31; p = 0.22). More research is required to establish HMB's influence on FFM in athletes. It is also important to consider the dosage of HMB and training parameters of athletes because these will likely influence the efficacy of supplementation.",

This study sought to determine the effect of combining HMB with creatine monohydrate supplementation on measures of stress and muscle damage, body composition, strength and sprinting kinetics throughout a rugby season. This double-blind, cross-over investigation recruited 16 male collegiate rugby players to provide resting blood samples and complete assessments of body composition, strength and sprinting performance prior to their fall season (PRE). After testing, the athletes were matched for fat-free mass and assigned to consume one of two supplementation regimens for 6\u2009weeks: 5\u2009g HMB\u2009+\u20095\u2009g creatine per day (HMB-Cr: 20.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009years; 177\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009cm; 88.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u2009kg) or 5\u2009g creatine +\u20095\u2009g placebo per day (Cr: 21.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009years; 179\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009cm; 88.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u2009kg). After 6\u2009weeks (POST), PRE testing was repeated in 13 of the original 16 athletes before a 10-wk wash-out period. Athletes who returned for the spring season (n\u2009=\u20098) repeated all fall-season procedures and testing prior to (PRE) and following (POST) their 6-wk spring season, except they were assigned to the opposite supplementation regimen. Linear mixed models with repeated measures revealed group x time interactions (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.05) for observed for several measures but did not consistently and positively favor one group. During the fall season, knee extensor peak torque was reduced by 40.7\u2009\u00b1\u200928.1\u2009Nm (p\u2009=\u20090.035) for HMB-Cr but remained consistent for Cr, and no group differences or changes were noted in the spring. In the spring, greater knee flexor rate of torque development (~\u2009149\u2009Nm\u00b7sec, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and impulse (~\u20094.5\u2009Nm\u00b7sec, p\u2009=\u20090.022) were observed in Cr at PRE but not at POST. Although significant interactions were found for cortisol concentrations, vastus lateralis pennation angle, and sprinting force, post-hoc analysis only revealed differences between fall and spring seasons. No other differences were observed. The combination of HMB and creatine monohydrate supplementation does not provide a greater ergogenic benefit compared to creatine monohydrate supplementation alone. Body composition, strength, and sprinting ability did not change across the season with creatine monohydrate supplementation.",

          "content": "Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a popular supplement in the resistance training community, with its use supported by claims of increased strength, muscle growth, and improved recovery; however, research outcomes are variable. Therefore, we meta-analyzed the effectiveness of HMB on strength, body composition, and muscle damage. Nine qualifying studies yielded 14 comparisons subcategorized by training experience (trained, untrained) to provide 12-13 estimates of strength (upper body, lower body, overall average), 13 estimates of fat and fat-free mass, and 7 estimates of the muscle-damage marker creatine kinase. The meta-analysis comprised 394 subjects (age 23 +/- 2 years, mean +/- between-study SD) with 5 +/- 2 weeks' intervention and 5 +/- 6 h.wk of training. The estimates were analyzed using a meta-analytic mixed model with study sample size as the weighting factor that included the main-effect covariates to control for between-study differences in HMB dose, intervention duration, training load, and dietary cointervention. To interpret magnitudes, meta-analyzed effects were standardized using the composite baseline between-subject SD and were qualified using modified Cohen effect size thresholds. There were small benefits to lower-body (mean +/- 90% confidence limit: 9.9% +/- 5.9%) and average strength (6.6 +/- 5.7%), but only negligible gains for upper-body strength (2.1 +/- 5.5%) were observed in untrained lifters. In trained lifters, all strength outcomes were trivial. Combined (all studies), the overall average strength increase was trivial (3.7 +/- 2.4%), although uncertainty allows for a small benefit. Effects on fat and fat-free mass were trivial, and results regarding creatine kinase were unclear. Supplementation with HMB during resistance training incurs small but clear overall and leg strength gains in previously untrained men, but effects in trained lifters are trivial. The HMB effect on body composition is inconsequential. An explanation for strength gains in previously untrained lifters requires further research.",

          "content": "Growing evidence suggests beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate's (HMB) positive effects on recovery following exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). However, findings vary substantially across studies. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to assess the effects of HMB supplementation on recovery following EIMD by assessing indirect markers of muscle damage, namely creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels among healthy participants. A comprehensive search was performed on electronic databases (Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar) up to October 2017 for trials evaluating the effects of HMB on recovery following EIMD. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation of follow-up CK and LDH concentrations were extracted to calculate the effect size for meta-analysis. A total of 324 participants for CK and 229 participants for LDH were found from the 10 and 8 studies, respectively. The results revealed a significant effect of HMB supplementation on CK (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -60.71 UL; 95% confidence interval [CI], -78.12 to -43.29; I = 4.1%; p = 0.40) and LDH reduction (WMD = -15.42 UL; 95% CI, -22.2 to -8.6; I = 0.0%; p = 0.53). In addition, a subgroup analysis based on study duration (< 6\u00a0weeks vs. \u2265 6\u00a0weeks) suggested that HMB effectiveness on EIMD was statistically significant in studies over 6\u00a0weeks (p < 0.001). The current evidence revealed a time-dependent effect of HMB in reducing LDH and CK serum levels among adults. HMB, therefore, may be seen as a priority muscle damage recovery agent in interventions.",

Effects of HMB on endurance performance in a healthy population: a systematic review and meta-analysis. J Strength Cond Res 38(4): e202-e210, 2024-\u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) has been used extensively as a dietary supplement for athletes and physically active people. However, the ergogenic effect of HMB supplementation on endurance performance is still unclear. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) aimed to assess HMB supplementation on endurance performance and V\u0307O 2 max . This SRMA followed PRISMA guidelines. Three electronic databases were searched (PubMed/Medline, Web of Science [WOS], and Scopus) from inception until April 3, 2023. In this SRMA, human experimental trials, controlled with a placebo group, assessing the effect of HMB supplementation on endurance performance in a healthy population were included. The quality of the studies was assessed by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The study protocol was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Review (PROSPERO): CRD42022341790. Eleven studies involving 279 participants met the inclusion criteria. The results displayed a significant improvement on endurance performance (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.58 [0.28-0.87]) and V\u0307O 2 max (pooled SMD = 0.58 [0.21-0.95]) after HMB ingestion. Moreover, after the exclusion of the studies not evenly distributed around the base of the funnel plot, the results continued to be significantly positive in endurance performance (pooled SMD = 0.38 [0.22-0.53]) and V\u0307O 2 max (pooled SMD = 0.25 [0.09-0.42]). In conclusion, HMB (3 g\u00b7d -1 ) ingestion during 2-12 weeks significantly improves endurance performance and V\u0307O 2 max .",

          "content": "Creatine monohydrate (CrM) and \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) are common ergogenic aids in the field of sports and are frequently used in an isolated way. However, there are a few studies that have investigated the effect of combining both supplements on different variables related to performance, with controversial results. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and the degree of potentiation of 10 weeks of CrM plus HMB supplementation on sports performance, which was measured by an incremental test to exhaustion in elite male traditional rowers. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 10-week study, participants ( = 28) were randomized to a placebo group (PLG;  = 7), CrM group (0.04 g/kg/day of CrM;  = 7), HMB group (3 g/day of HMB;  = 7) and CrM-HMB group (0.04 g/kg/day of CrM plus 3 g/day of HMB;  = 7). Before and after 10 weeks of different treatments, an incremental test was performed on a rowing ergometer to calculate the power that each rower obtained at the anaerobic threshold (WAT), and at 4 mmol (W4) and 8 mmol (W8) of blood lactate concentration. There were no significant differences in WAT and W4 among groups or in body composition. However, it was observed that the aerobic power achieved at W8 was significantly higher in the CrM-HMB group than in the PLG, CrM and HMB groups ( < 0.001; \u03b72 = 0.766). Likewise, a synergistic effect of combined supplementation was found for the sum of the two supplements separately at WAT (CrM-HMBG = 403.19% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 337.52%), W4 (CrM-HMBG = 2736.17% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 1705.32%) and W8 (CrM-HMBG = 1293.4% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 877.56%). In summary, CrM plus HMB supplementation over 10 weeks showed a synergistic effect on aerobic power (measured as WAT, W4, and W8) during an incremental test but had no influence muscle mass.",

          "content": "Although beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine (Arg), and glutamine (Gln) may contribute to wound healing, no prospective studies have investigated the efficacy of a compound consisting of HMB, Arg, and Gln (HMB/Arg/Gln) for reducing wound complications following open abdominal surgery. This study evaluates the usefulness of perioperative nutrition using HMB/Arg/Gln in patients who were scheduled to undergo open surgery for abdominal malignancies in a randomized controlled trial. Patients scheduled for open surgery for abdominal malignancies were randomized to receive HMB/Arg/Gln (1.2 g HMB, 7 g L-Arg, and 7 g L-Gln) or placebo (isocaloric juice). The supplements were provided once daily for 3 days preoperatively and once daily for 7 days postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the incidence of wound complications. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of other complications, postoperative duration of hospital stay, total-body skeletal muscle mass, handgrip strength, and skin water content. Sixty-one patients were randomly assigned to either the HMB/Arg/Gln (n = 31) or the placebo (n = 30) group. One patient in the HMB/Arg/Gln group was ineligible because laparoscopic surgery was performed; thus, 60 patients were analyzed. The incidence of wound complications (20%) was the same in both groups (P = 1.000). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other complications, body composition, handgrip strength, or skin water content between the 2 groups. Serum growth hormone (GH) levels were significantly higher for patients whose total intake was > 80% of planned volume in the HMB/Arg/Gln group. The incidence of wound complications would not be reduced by perioperative HMB/Arg/Gln administration in patients who underwent open surgery. The efficacy of HMB/Arg/Gln for increasing serum GH levels needs to be validated in another large-scale randomized controlled trial.",

Outcomes investigated were: total body mass (TBM), FFM, fat mass (FM), total single repetition maximum (1RM), bench press (BP) 1RM, and lower body (LwB) 1RM. Databases consulted were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (Embase), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SportDiscus. Fourteen studies fit the inclusion criteria; however, 11 were analyzed after data extraction and funnel plot analysis exclusion. A total of 302 participants (18-45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 248 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes. We conclude that HMB produces a small effect on TBM gain, but this effect does not translate into significantly greater increases in FFM, strength or decreases in FM during periods of RET.

          "title": "Association between endogenous plasma beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate levels and frailty in community-dwelling older people.",
          "content": "Frailty is a key element in healthy ageing in which muscle performance plays a main role. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation has shown favourable effects in modulating protein synthesis, improving muscle mass and function in interventional studies. Decreased age-related endogenous HMB levels have been shown in previous studies. The aim of the present study is to assess whether there is an association between endogenous plasma HMB levels and frailty. Data from 1290 subjects (56.98% women; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation age 74.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.95\u00a0years) from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging were obtained. Participants had their frailty status qualified according to Fried's Frailty Phenotype (FFP) score and the Frailty Trait Scale in its 12-domain version (FTS-12). Plasma HMB levels were analysed by an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Differences between groups (frail vs. non-frail) were tested using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-squared test. The association between HMB and frailty was assessed by multivariate linear and logistic regressions when frailty was analysed as continuous and binary, respectively. Models were adjusted by age, gender, comorbidity, body composition and protein intake. HMB levels were lower in those aged \u226575\u00a0years than in those aged 65-74\u00a0years, with an inverse linear relationship between age and HMB levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.031; P\u00a0=\u00a00.018), mainly accounted by males (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.062; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). HMB levels were higher in men (0.238\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.065 vs. 0.193\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.051\u00a0ng/mL; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). HMB levels were significantly lower in frail than in non-frail individuals: 0.204\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.058 versus 0.217\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.063\u00a0ng/dL (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) according to the FFP and 0.203\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.059 versus 0.219\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.063\u00a0ng/mL (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) according to FTS-12. These differences showed a dose-dependent profile when we compared them by quintiles of HMB (P for trend: 0.022; 0.012 and 0.0004, respectively, for FFP, FTS-12 binary and FTS-12 continuous). Variables associated with low HMB levels were body mass index, strength, exhaustion and weight loss. Frailty was associated with HMB levels in all the adjusted models, including the fully adjusted ones, no matter the tool used (odds ratio: 0.45 [0.26, 0.77] for FFP and 0.36 [0.20, 0.63] for FTS-12 binary; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-4.76 [-7.29, -2.23] for FTS-12 score). This association was also observed when the analyses were done by quintiles, showing such association since Q4 (FFP), Q2 (FTS-12 binary) and Q3 (FTS-12 score). The associations were observed in the whole sample and in each gender. There is an inverse association between HMB levels and frailty status. These findings support the design of targeted clinical trials to evaluate the effect of HMB supplementation in older frail people with low HMB levels.",

This secondary analysis aimed to test whether \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation enhances the effects of resistance training (RT) on MQ in older women with low muscle mass. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-by-two factorial design trial was conducted at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. Women age 65-79 yr with a skeletal muscle mass index of <5.7 kg\u00b7m-2 were randomly allocated to one of four arms (RT + HMB, RT + placebo, education + HMB, and education + placebo). Participants attended supervised RT sessions twice weekly or education programs every 2 wk and were provided calcium-HMB (1500 mg) or placebo supplements once daily for 12 wk. The main outcomes were changes in functional MQ, assessed by knee extension strength per quadriceps thickness, and compositional MQ, assessed by the echo intensity of the rectus femoris muscle. Overall, 156 and 149 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments, respectively. Two-factorial analysis of variance showed no significant interaction of HMB supplementation with RT in terms of functional or compositional MQ. Main-effects analyses revealed that the decline in functional MQ of the group performing RT was smaller by 0.71 N\u00b7mm-1 (95% confidence interval, 0.11-1.31) compared with that in the education group. No significant main effects of RT or HMB supplementation on compositional MQ were observed. HMB supplementation did not enhance the treatment effects of RT for either MQ parameter; however, RT reduced the decline in functional MQ. Thus, adding HMB supplementation to RT is not significantly useful for improving MQ in this population.",

          "content": "This study aimed to determine the effect of postexercise protein-leucine coingestion with CHO-lipid on subsequent high-intensity endurance performance and to investigate candidate mechanisms using stable isotope methods and metabolomics. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 male cyclists ingested a leucine/protein/CHO/fat supplement (LEUPRO 7.5/20/89/22 g \u00b7 h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric CHO/fat control (119/22 g \u00b7 h(-1)) 1-3 h after exercise during a 6-d training block (intense intervals, recovery, repeated-sprint performance rides). Daily protein intake was clamped at 1.9 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (LEUPRO) and 1.5 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (control). Stable isotope infusions (1-(13)C-leucine and 6,6-(2)H2-glucose), mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and nitrogen balance methods were used to determine the effects of LEUPRO on whole-body branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and glucose metabolism and protein turnover. After exercise, LEUPRO increased BCAA levels in plasma (2.6-fold; 90% confidence limits = \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and urine (2.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.2) and increased products of BCAA metabolism plasma acylcarnitine C5 (3.0-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 0.9) and urinary leucine (3.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.3) and \u03b2-aminoisobutyrate (3.4-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.4), indicating that ingesting ~10 g leucine per hour during recovery exceeds the capacity to metabolize BCAA. Furthermore, LEUPRO increased leucine oxidation (5.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and nonoxidative disposal (4.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and left leucine balance positive relative to control. With the exception of day 1 (LEUPRO = 17 \u00b1 20 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = -90 \u00b1 44 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)), subsequent (days 2-5) nitrogen balance was positive for both conditions (LEUPRO = 130 \u00b1 110 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = 111 \u00b1 86 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)). Compared with control feeding, LEUPRO lowered the serum creatine kinase concentration by 21%-25% (90% confidence limits = \u00b1 14%), but the effect on sprint power was trivial (day 4 = 0.4% \u00b1 1.0%, day 6 = -0.3% \u00b1 1.0%). Postexercise protein-leucine supplementation saturates BCAA metabolism and attenuates tissue damage, but effects on subsequent intense endurance performance may be inconsequential under conditions of positive daily nitrogen balance.",

          "content": "Although branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) are known to stimulate myofibrillar protein synthesis and affect insulin signaling and kynurenine metabolism (the latter being a metabolite of tryptophan associated with depression and dementia), the effects of BCAA supplementation on type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not clear. Therefore, a 24-week, prospective randomized open blinded-endpoint trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplementation of 8 g of BCAA or 7.5 g of soy protein on skeletal muscle and glycemic control as well as adverse events in elderly individuals with T2D. Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to the BCAA group ( = 21) and the soy protein group ( = 15). Skeletal muscle mass and HbA1c, which were primary endpoints, did not change over time or differ between groups. However, knee extension muscle strength was significantly increased in the soy protein group and showed a tendency to increase in the BCAA group. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance did not significantly change during the trial. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved in the BCAA group but the difference between groups was not significant. Results suggested that BCAA supplementation may not affect skeletal muscle mass and glycemic control and may improve depressive symptoms in elderly individuals with T2D.",

Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2014-2018 were used. Overall, 4852 participants aged \u226565 years were included in the study. Demographic, lifestyle, and health data were obtained through interviews and questionnaires. The 24-h recall method was used to assess dietary intake. An amino acid database was established using the 9th revision of the Korean Standard Food Composition Table. The mean handgrip strength was estimated from triplicate measurements obtained using the dominant hand. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between BCAA intake and handgrip strength. Grains greatly contributed to amino acid intake; however, a significant negative association was observed between handgrip strength and increased BCAA intake through grains. In the fully adjusted model, leucine intake and handgrip strength showed a positive association. Thus, consuming BCAAs (especially leucine) via a variety of food sources can help maintain muscle health in older people.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia is associated with adverse outcomes in cirrhosis. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) target several pathways that lead to muscle loss in this population. We aimed to evaluate the impact of BCAA supplementation on sarcopenia measures in patients with cirrhosis. We conducted a 12-month double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial of BCAA supplementation (30\u2009g daily) compared to an equicaloric, equi-nitrogenous whey protein in volunteers with cirrhosis and reduced muscle strength. The primary endpoint was an increase in grip strength and upper limb lean mass measured on DEXA. Mean-adjusted differences (MAD, 95% CI) between groups at 6 and 12 months are reported as treatment effect using a linear mixed model for repeated measures. A total of 150 volunteers entered the trial (74 BCAA, 76 control), with a median age of 58\u2009years [IQR 48; 63] and MELD of 14 [12; 17]. At 12 months, 57% in the BCAA arm and 61% in the control arm met the primary endpoint (p\u2009=\u20090.80). No significant between-group difference was found in grip strength (MAD -0.15\u2009kg [-0.37; 0.06], p\u2009=\u20090.29) or upper limb lean mass (1.7\u2009kg [-0.2; 3.6], p\u2009=\u20090.22) at 12 months. No significant differences in other body composition parameters, physical performance, frailty, rates of hospitalisation or mortality were found between the BCAA and the control group. Fatigue improved across the entire cohort, without significant between-group differences. 15% of volunteers reported side effects, with distaste higher in the BCAA arm (p\u2009=\u20090.045).

          "content": "The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation taken before or after exercise on delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Fifteen young men (aged 21.5\u00b10.4 years) were given either BCAA (9.6 g\u00b7day-1) or placebo before and after exercise (and for 3 days prior to and following the exercise day) in three independent groups: the control group (placebo before and after exercise), the PRE group (BCAA before exercise and placebo after exercise), and the POST group (placebo before exercise and BCAA after exercise). Participants performed 30 repetitions of eccentric exercise with the non-dominant arm. DOMS, upper arm circumference (CIR), elbow range of motion (ROM), serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase, BCAA, and \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (3HMB) were measured immediately before and after the exercise and on the following 4 days. Serum BCAA and 3HMB concentrations increased significantly in the PRE group immediately after the exercise, recovering to baseline over the following days. In the days following the exercise day, DOMS, CIR, and ROM were significantly improved in the PRE group compared to the control group, with weaker effects in the POST group. Serum activities of CK, LDH, and aldolase in the days following the exercise day were significantly suppressed in the PRE group compared to control group. The present study confirmed that repeated BCAA supplementation before exercise had a more beneficial effect in attenuating DOMS and EIMD induced by eccentric exercise than repeated supplementation after exercise.",

          "title": "The Influence of Competition Day Loads on the Metabolic and Immune Response of Olympic Female Beach Volleyball Athletes: A Sportomics Analysis.",
          "content": "Beach volleyball (BVb) is a highly demanding Olympic sport characterized by intense physical activity and unique environmental challenges, including varying weather conditions and sandy, unstable court surfaces. Despite its popularity, there is a notable lack of scientific research addressing the metabolic and immune responses of elite female athletes in this sport. This study aims to address this gap by investigating two world-class Olympic medalists, female BVb players, who represent a country with a rich history in the sport.  Two athletes underwent a simulated competition day consisting of two matches. A standardized protocol was utilized to collect blood and urine samples at seven time points, allowing for analysis throughout the competition and recovery phases. The analysis included various electrolytes, as well as hematological, metabolic, and inflammatory markers. Additionally, we assessed selected hormones, such as insulin, serotonin, ACTH, and cortisol, along with amino acids related to energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis.  Both athletes presented a trend toward electrolyte disturbances, especially hypokalemia, with a mean decrease of 15% and individual values reaching as low as 3.3 mmol/L post-match. This indicates that BVb may pose a risk for such disturbances. Additionally, the matches led to 20% to 60% increases in muscle injury markers, with incomplete recovery even after a day of rest, signaling persistent physiological stress post-competition. This increase was matched by stimulating stress hormones (ACTH and cortisol rose up to 4-fold and 3-fold, respectively), and markers of exercise intensity, such as lactate and ammonium. Moreover, the simulated BVb competition day impacted the amino acid response, with the Fischer ratio (BCAA/AAA) and blood tryptophan decreasing to a minimum of 60% of the initial levels and blood serotonin increasing by up to 180%, which are signs of an increased risk of central fatigue onset, according to the Fischer and Newsholme theory.  The responses examined in this exploratory study contribute to a deeper understanding of the metabolic and immune demands placed on elite female BVb players, suggesting practical applications. By addressing the similar physiological responses observed among the athletes and emphasizing their unique individual responses-despite following the same protocol under identical conditions and sharing similar life habits for an extended period-this study highlights the critical necessity for the n-of-1 monitoring of athletes.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia and myosteatosis are common in patients with cirrhosis. The study aimed to evaluate efficacy of ultrasound to monitor muscle status during branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation and/or muscle exercise interventional approaches. A randomized controlled study, included 220 liver cirrhosis patients with Child- Pugh B and C, randomized into a control group (55 patients) received only the standard care, and interventional groups (165 patients) equally distributed into three subgroups, in addition to standard care, they received BCAA, programmed exercise, or BCAA and programmed exercise. At baseline and after 28 days, all participants were subjected to ultrasound-measured quadriceps muscle thickness and echo-intensity, muscle strength using handgrip, performance using short physical performance battery (SPPB), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and nutritional assessment using 7- point Subjective Global Assessment Score (SGA) and laboratory assessment. All interventional groups showed a significant improvement in the ultrasound detected quadriceps muscle thickness (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and echo intensity, in addition to muscle strength, muscle performance, and SGA. Hematological parameters (hemoglobin and platelet count), biochemical parameters (ALT, AST, bilirubin, creatinine, urea and INR) and MELD score were also improved in the interventional groups. In Child-Pugh B patients BCAA combined with exercise showed an add-on effect. BCAA supplements, programed muscle exercise and both are useful interventional methods in improving muscle quality and quantity in cirrhosis patients, which can be monitored by ultrasound. The best results can be achieved by combined intervention in Child-Pugh B, while in Child-Pugh C single intervention may lead to an acceptable improvement. The trial was registered retrospectively in the Clinical Trials Registry (registration number NCT06088550).",

          "content": "Since the 1980's there has been high interest in branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) by sports nutrition scientists. The metabolism of BCAA is involved in some specific biochemical muscle processes and many studies have been carried out to understand whether sports performance can be enhanced by a BCAA supplementation. However, many of these researches have failed to confirm this hypothesis. Thus, in recent years investigators have changed their research target and focused on the effects of BCAA on the muscle protein matrix and the immune system. Data show that BCAA supplementation before and after exercise has beneficial effects for decreasing exercise-induced muscle damage and promoting muscle-protein synthesis. Muscle damage develops delayed onset muscle soreness: a syndrome that occurs 24-48 h after intensive physical activity that can inhibit athletic performance. Other recent works indicate that BCAA supplementation recovers peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation in response to mitogens after a long distance intense exercise, as well as plasma glutamine concentration. The BCAA also modifies the pattern of exercise-related cytokine production, leading to a diversion of the lymphocyte immune response towards a Th1 type. According to these findings, it is possible to consider the BCAA as a useful supplement for muscle recovery and immune regulation for sports events.",

However, it is unknown whether amino acids and/or vitamin D are beneficial in older adults following lumbar surgery for LSS. To evaluate whether branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) plus vitamin D supplementation could attenuate the loss of muscle mass and strength, accelerate the return of functional mobility, and improve clinical outcomes following lumbar surgery for LSS. A single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial. Eighty patients who received lumbar surgery for LSS. The primary outcome was the Zurich claudication questionnaire (ZCQ), and secondary outcomes included knee muscle strength, muscle mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis, gait speed and a timed up-and-go test (TUG) at 12 weeks postoperatively. Follow-up assessment was performed for the ZCQ at 52 weeks postoperatively. Patients ingested the supplementation (BCAA group: BCAA plus vitamin D, Nonamino acid group: nonamino acid) twice daily for 3 weeks from the day after surgery, and received two hours of postoperative inpatient rehabilitation 5 times a week. No significant differences were observed in the mean changes on the ZCQ between the two groups at 12 weeks and 52 weeks. At 2 weeks postoperatively, the nonamino acid group showed significant deterioration compared with the BCAA group for strengths of knee extensor and knee flexor (p\u200a<\u200a.01). At 12 weeks, the BCAA group showed significant improvements in knee extensor strength and knee flexor strength compared with the nonamino acid group (p\u200a<.01). There were no significant differences in mean changes of muscle mass, maximum gait speed, and TUG at 12 weeks between two groups. BCAA plus vitamin D supplementation did not improve LSS-related clinical outcomes after lumbar surgery for LSS, even though muscle strength increased. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes for muscle mass and physical function, including development of sarcopenia and frailty.",

The aim of this study was to compare the amino acid concentrations at each stage of sarcopenia (normal, pre-sarcopenia, dynapenia, and sarcopenia) in community-dwelling older Japanese adults. Community-dwelling older Japanese women (n=232, 79.4\u00b17.0 years) participated in this study. We measured plasma amino acid concentrations, 5-m walking speed, grip strength, and skeletal muscle mass using a bioelectrical impedance data acquisition system and compared them among participants at each stage of sarcopenia. The proportions of normal, pre-sarcopenia, dynapenia, and sarcopenia patients were 40.5% (n=94), 12.1% (n=28), 26.3% (n=61), and 21.1% (n=49), respectively. Significant differences were observed for concentrations of leucine, branched-chain amino acid (BCAAs), and essential amino acid (EAAs) among the four groups (p<0.05), and the dynapenia and sarcopenia groups showed significantly lower concentrations of leucine than the normal group (p<0.05). This study indicated a positive relationship between plasma leucine, BCAA and EAA concentrations and muscle function. A longitudinal study is needed to determine the causal relationship between leucine/BCAA concentrations and muscle function.",

In total, 25 studies were included, consisting of 479 participants (age 24.3 \u00b1 8.3 years, height 1.73 \u00b1 0.06 m, body mass 70.8 \u00b1 9.5 kg, females 26.3%). These studies were rated as fair to excellent following the PEDro scale. The outcome measures were compared between the BCAA and placebo conditions at 24 and 48 hours following muscle-damaging exercises, using standardised mean differences and associated -values via forest plots. Our meta-analysis demonstrated significantly lower levels of indirect muscle damage markers (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and myoglobin) at 48 hours post-exercise (standardised mean difference [SMD] = -0.41;  < 0.05) for the BCAA than placebo conditions, whilst muscle soreness was significant at 24 hours post-exercise (SMD = -0.28 \u2264  \u2264 -0.61;  < 0.05) and 48 hours post-exercise (SMD = -0.41 \u2264 \u2264 -0.92;  < 0.01). However, no significant differences were identified between the BCAA and placebo conditions for muscle performance at 24 or 48 hours post-exercise (SMD = 0.08 \u2264  \u2264 0.21;  > 0.05). Overall, BCAA reduced the level of muscle damage biomarkers and muscle soreness following muscle-damaging exercises. However, the potential benefits of BCAA for muscle performance recovery is questionable and warrants further investigation to determine the practicality of BCAA for ameliorating muscle damage symptoms in diverse populations. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020191248.  BCAA reduces the level of creatine kinase and muscle soreness following strenuous exercise with a dose-response relationship.

Plasma BCAA levels were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Physical performance was analyzed with a hand grip strength test, 4 m walking test, sit-to-stand test, timed up and go test, standing balance test and clinical frailty scale. We included 92 patients (65% men). The Child Pugh Turcotte classification was significantly higher in the lowest sex-stratified BCAA tertile compared to the highest tertile ( = 0.015). The times for the sit-to-stand (r = -0.352,  < 0.05) and timed up and go tests (r = -0.472,  < 0.01) were inversely correlated with total BCAA levels. In conclusion, lower circulating BCAA are associated with the severity of liver disease and impaired muscle function.

          "content": "Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is one of the most commonly performed weight loss (WL) bariatric procedures. The main goal of WL is reducing total body weight (TBW) and fat mass (FM). However, TBW loss is systematically accompanied by a decline in fat-free mass (FFM), predominantly in the first post-surgical month, despite protein supplementation. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and vitamin D seem to attenuate loss of FFM and, thus, reduce the decline in muscle strength (MS). However, data on the role of an integrated supplementation with whey protein plus BCAAs plus vitamin D (P+BCAAs+Vit.D) vs. protein alone on total weight loss (TWL), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and (MS) in the first month after SG are lacking. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the impact of P+BCAAs+Vit.D vs. protein alone supplementation on TWL, FM, FFM, and MS in the first month after SG. Before SG and at 1 month afterward, we prospectively measured and compared TBW, FM, FFM, and MS in 57 patients who received either a supplementation with P+BCAAs+Vit.D (n = 31) or protein alone (n = 26). The impact of P+BCAAs+Vit.D and protein alone supplementation on clinical status was also evaluated. Despite non-significant variation in TBW, FM decreased more significantly (18.5% vs. 13.2%,  = 0.023) with the P+BCAA+Vit.D supplementation compared to protein alone. Furthermore, the P+BCAA+Vit.D group showed a significantly lower decrease in FFM (4.1% vs. 11.4%,  < 0.001) and MS (3.8% vs. 18.5%,  < 0.001) compared to the protein alone group. No significant alterations in clinical status were seen in either group. P+BCAA+Vit.D supplementation is more effective than protein alone in determining FM loss and is associated with a lower decrease in FFM and MS, without interfering with clinical status in patients 1 month after SG.",

Although branched chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation has shown improvements in neurocognitive and sleep function in pre-clinical animal models of mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), to date, no studies have been performed evaluating the efficacy of BCAAs in concussed adolescents and young adults. The goal of this pilot trial was to determine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of varied doses of oral BCAA supplementation in a group of concussed adolescents and young adults. The study was conducted as a pilot, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of participants ages 11-34 presenting with concussion to outpatient clinics (sports medicine and primary care), urgent care, and emergency departments of a tertiary care pediatric children's hospital and an urban tertiary care adult hospital, between June 24, 2014 and December 5, 2020. Participants were randomized to one of five study arms (placebo and 15\u2009g, 30\u2009g, 45\u2009g, and 54\u2009g BCAA treatment daily) and followed for 21 days after enrollment. Outcome measures included daily computerized neurocognitive tests (processing speed, the  primary outcome; and attention, visual learning, and working memory), symptom score, physical and cognitive activity, sleep/wake alterations, treatment compliance, and adverse events. In total, 42 participants were randomized, 38 of whom provided analyzable data. We found no difference in our primary outcome of processing speed between the arms; however, there was a significant reduction in total symptom score (decrease of 4.4 points on a 0-54 scale for every 500\u2009g of study drug consumed,  value for trend\u2009=\u20090.0036, [uncorrected]) and return to physical activity (increase of 0.503 points on a 0-5 scale for every 500\u2009g of study drug consumed,  value for trend\u2009=\u20090.005 [uncorrected]). There were no serious adverse events. Eight of 38 participants reported a mild (not interfering with daily activity) or moderate (limitation of daily activity) adverse event; there were no differences in adverse events by arm, with only two reported mild adverse events (both gastrointestinal) in the highest (45\u2009g and 54\u2009g) BCAA arms. Although limited by slow enrollment, small sample size, and missing data, this study provides the first demonstration of efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability, of BCAAs in concussed adolescents and young adults; specifically, a dose-response effect in reducing concussion symptoms and a return to baseline physical activity in those treated with higher total doses of BCAAs. These findings provide important preliminary data to inform a larger trial of BCAA therapy to expedite concussion recovery.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia, the age-related decrease in muscle mass and function can result in adverse health outcomes and subsequent loss of independence. Inadequate nutrition is an important contributor to the aetiology of sarcopenia, and dietary strategies are studied to prevent or delay this geriatric syndrome. The present study investigated whether there is an association between biochemical nutrient status markers, muscle parameters and sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. Data from the cross-sectional Maastricht Sarcopenia study (MaSS) were used, in which skeletal muscle index (SMI), 4 meter gait speed, 5 times chair stand and handgrip strength were assessed among older adults (n=227). Sarcopenia was defined following the algorithm of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Fasted blood samples were analyses on amino acids levels, RBC phospholipid profile, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), \u03b1-tocopherol, magnesium and homocysteine were determined in fasted blood levels. Generalized linear modelling and logistic regression were used for data analysis. Lower blood levels of essential amino acids (EAA), total branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and leucine were associated with lower SMI (P<0.001), strength (P<0.001) and longer time to complete the chair stand (P<0.05), whereas no association was found for total amino acids (TAA). Lower levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 25(OH)D and homocysteine were associated with lower muscle parameter values (P<0.05). No significant associations were found for SFA, MUFA, PUFA, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), \u03b1-tocopherol-cholesterol ratio and magnesium. Sarcopenia was more frequent among those with lower levels of leucine, BCAA, EAA, EPA, 25(OH)D and higher levels of homocysteine (P<0.05). Age and BMI were identified as relevant covariates. A robust association was only found for lower gait speed and lower 25(OH)D levels. Compromised muscle parameters are associated with low blood values of specific amino acids, fatty acids, vitamin D and high homocysteine.",

However, there is no study comparing this coingestion to the same nutrients without caffeine. We assessed whether ketone salts-caffeine-taurine-leucine (KCT) supplementation was superior to caffeine-free ketone salts-taurine-leucine supplementation (KT), or to an isoenergetic carbohydrate placebo (CHO-PLAC). Thirteen recreationally active men (mean \u00b1 SD: 177.5 \u00b1 6.1\u00a0cm, 75.9 \u00b1 4.6\u00a0kg, 23 \u00b1 3 years, 12.0 \u00b1 5.1% body fat) completed a best effort 20-km cycling time-trial, followed 15\u00a0min later by a Wingate power cycle test, after supplementing with either KCT (approximately 7\u00a0g of beta-hydroxybutyrate, approximately 120\u00a0mg of caffeine, 2.1\u00a0g of leucine, and 2.7\u00a0g of taurine), KT (i.e.,\u00a0same supplement without caffeine), or isoenergetic CHO-PLAC (11\u00a0g of dextrose). Blood ketones were elevated (p < .001) after ingestion of both KCT (0.65 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0mmol/L) and KT (0.72 \u00b1 0.31\u00a0mmol/L) relative to CHO-PLAC (0.06 \u00b1 0.05\u00a0mmol/L). Moreover, KCT improved (p < .003) 20-km cycling time-trial performance (37.80 \u00b1 2.28\u00a0min), compared with CHO-PLAC (39.40 \u00b1 3.33\u00a0min) but not versus KT (38.75 \u00b1 2.87\u00a0min; p < .09). 20-km cycling time-trial average power output was greater with KCT (power output = 180.5 \u00b1 28.7\u00a0W) versus both KT (170.9 \u00b1 31.7\u00a0W; p = .049) and CHO-PLAC (164.8 \u00b1 34.7\u00a0W; p = .001). Wingate peak power output was also greater for both KCT (1,134 \u00b1 137\u00a0W; p = .031) and KT (1,132 \u00b1 128\u00a0W; p = .039) versus CHO-PLAC (1,068 \u00b1 127\u00a0W). These data suggest that the observed improved exercise performance effects of this multi-ingredient supplement containing beta-hydroxybutyrate salts, taurine, and leucine are attributed partially to the addition of caffeine.",

J Strength Cond Res 34(12): 3475-3481, 2020-This study investigated the effects of caffeine and taurine coingestion on repeat-sprint cycling performance and associated physiological and perceptual responses. In a double-blind, cross-over, repeated measures study, 11 male subjects (age 21 \u00b1 2 years; stature 178 \u00b1 7 cm; body mass 80 \u00b1 13 kg) completed 10 \u00d7 6-second sprints on a cycle ergometer, each separated by 24 seconds, one hour after ingesting: caffeine (80 mg) and taurine (1 g), equivalent to the amount observed in popular commercial energy drinks, or placebo (maltodextrin \u223c1 g) in a gelatine capsule. Performance was measured on a cycle ergometer, whereas blood lactate concentration (B[la]), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and heart rate (HR) were measured at baseline (pre-exercise) and after sprints 5 and 10. Magnitude-based inferences revealed likely, trivial differences in peak power and unclear, trivial intersprint fatigue index after ingestion of the caffeine and taurine supplement. Intrasprint fatigue was greater in the caffeine and taurine condition at sprint 10 (likely, small) and possibly smaller in sprints 6-9. The caffeine and taurine supplement had a likely large effect on HR at baseline (effect size = 0.94) and increases in B[la] after sprints 5 (likely small) and 10 (possibly small). There was no effect of the supplement on RPE (unclear, trivial). Administration of caffeine and taurine at doses equivalent to commercial energy drinks did not improve repeat-sprint cycling performance and seemed to induce greater fatigue within selected sprints, particularly at the end of the trial. This undesirable performance effect occurs in parallel with increased HR and glycolytic metabolic bi-products.",

          "content": "This study aimed to examine the effect of taurine ingestion on maximal voluntary muscle torque and power in trained male athletes with different caffeine habits. Fourteen male athletes 21.8 \u00b1 2.5 yr old were separated into caffeine and noncaffeine consumers to control for the effect of caffeine withdrawal on muscle function. On separate occasions, participants performed four isokinetic or three maximal isometric knee extensions with and without taurine (40 mg\u00b7kg body mass) after a double-blind, counterbalanced design. Muscle contractile performances were compared between the first sets as well as between the sets where these variables scored best. In response to isokinetic contraction, taurine treatment in the noncaffeine consumers resulted in a significant fall in first (-16.1%; P = 0.013) and best peak torque (-5.0%; P = 0.016) as well as in first (-17.7%; P = 0.015) and best power output (-8.0%; P = 0.008). In the caffeine consumers deprived of caffeine, taurine intake improved best power (5.2%; P = 0.045). With respect to the isometric variables, there was a significant decrease in the first (-5.1%; P = 0.002) and best peak torque (-4.3%; P = 0.032) in the noncaffeine group, but no effect in the group of caffeine consumers deprived of caffeine. Taurine ingestion increased blood taurine levels but had no effect on plasma amino acid levels. Taurine ingestion is detrimental to maximal voluntary muscle power and both maximal isokinetic and isometric peak torque in noncaffeine consumers, whereas taurine ingestion in caffeine-deprived caffeine consumers improves maximal voluntary muscle power but has no effect on other aspects of contractile performance.",

          "content": "Taurine is central to many physiological processes, some of which are augmented by exogenous supply and have the potential to facilitate endurance performance; however, its independent effects on performance have not been systematically analysed. To evaluate the effects of isolated oral taurine ingestion on endurance performance and to assess the contribution of (1) the dose and (2) the supplementation period to the ergogenic effect. A search was performed using various databases in September 2017. The studies were screened using search criteria for eligibility. Ten peer-reviewed articles were identified for inclusion. A sub-analysis of time-to-exhaustion (TTE) trials (n = 7) was also performed. The effects of (1) dose and (2) the acute (single dose) or chronic (> 1 day) supplementation periods were assessed using meta-regression. The doses of taurine ranged from 1 to 6\u00a0g/day and were provided in single doses and for up to 2\u00a0weeks among a range of subjects. Taurine ingestion improved overall endurance performance (Hedges' g\u00a0=\u00a00.40, 95% CI 0.12-0.67, P = 0.004), which was similar in TTE trials (Hedges' g = 0.43, 95% CI 0.12-0.75, P = 0.007). There were no differences between acute or chronic supplementation for the full sample (P = 0.897) or the TTE group (P = 0.896). The dose of taurine did not moderate its effect on endurance performance (P > 0.05). Human endurance performance can be improved by orally ingesting a single dose of taurine in varying amounts (1-6 g).",

          "content": "Taurine has become a popular supplement among athletes attempting to improve performance. While the effectiveness of taurine as an ergogenic aid remains controversial, this paper summarizes the current evidence regarding the efficacy of taurine in aerobic and anaerobic performance, metabolic stress, muscle soreness, and recovery. Google Scholar, Web of Science, and MedLine (PubMed) searches were conducted through September 2020. Peer-reviewed studies that investigated taurine as a single ingredient at dosages of <\u20091\u2009g - 6\u2009g, ranging from 10 to 15\u2009min-to-2\u2009h prior to exercise bout or chronic dose (7\u2009days- 8\u2009weeks) of consumption were included. Articles were excluded if taurine was not the primary or only ingredient in a supplement or food source, not published in peer-reviewed journals, if participants were older than 50\u2009years, articles published before 1999, animal studies, or included participants with health issues. A total of 19 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Key results include improvements in the following: VOmax, time to exhaustion (TTE; n\u2009=\u20095 articles), 3 or 4\u2009km time-trial (n\u2009=\u20092 articles), anaerobic performance (n\u2009=\u20097 articles), muscle damage (n\u2009=\u20093 articles), peak power (n\u2009=\u20092 articles), recovery (n\u2009=\u20091 article). Taurine also caused a change in metabolites: decrease in lactate, creatine kinase, phosphorus, inflammatory markers, and improved glycolytic/fat oxidation markers (n\u2009=\u20095 articles). Taurine dosing appears to be effective at ~\u20091-3\u2009g/day acutely across a span of 6-15\u2009days (1-3\u2009h before an activity) which may improve aerobic performance (TTE), anaerobic performance (strength, power), recovery (DOMS), and a decrease in metabolic markers (creatine kinase, lactate, inorganic phosphate). Limited and varied findings prohibit definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of taurine on aerobic and anaerobic performance and metabolic outcomes. There are mixed findings for the effect of taurine consumption on improving recovery from training bouts and/or mitigating muscle damage. The timing of taurine ingestion as well as the type of exercise protocol performed may contribute to the effectiveness of taurine as an ergogenic aid. More investigations are needed to better understand the potential effects of taurine supplementation on aerobic and anaerobic performance, muscle damage, metabolic stress, and recovery.",

          "content": "Taurine is released by contracting muscles, but its actual role remains unspecified. In this study, we investigated whether the exercise-stimulated release of taurine from muscle into the plasma regulates the modification of osmolality induced by intramuscular osmolyte production. Six subjects performed 90 min of cycling exercise (at 70% maximum power output) on two occasions, with (HC) or without (DC) fluid intake. Taurine content was determined in plasma, blood cells and urine before and after the endurance events, together with plasma osmolality. Plasma osmolality increased by 4% in the DC experiment ( P<0.01), but remained stable in the HC condition. The exercise also induced changes in the mean (SD) plasma taurine content to a greater degree in HC [+63 (26)%] than in DC [+33 (18)%; P<0.05], supporting the hypothesis that taurine is released into the plasma via an osmoregulatory process. However, the higher plasma taurine content in HC was not related to changes in renal taurine. In addition, the increase of taurine in plasma was not related to its release from blood cells since their taurine concentration increased by 70% both in HC [429 (77) to 680 (82) microM; P=0.003] and in DC [451 (57) to 731 (34) microM; P<0.001]. The lack of correlation between plasma volume modification and the mass ratio of taurine would exclude a major role for taurine exchange in plasma volume regulation. Sodium ( R=0.967, P<0.001), chloride ( R=0.917, P<0.001) and osmolality ( R=0.924, P<0.001) seem to be the main regulators of plasma volume changes during exercise. In conclusion, changes in the plasma taurine content during endurance exercise is related to an osmoregulatory process, but this alone does not control plasma volume changes.",

          "content": "The impact of hypoxic repetitive sprint training on the overall performance of team sports remains controversial due to the specific nature of the exercise capacity required for team sports. While taurine and caffeine are widely utilized as supplements for repetitive sprint exercise in normoxic environments, their efficacy in hypoxic environments remains to be fully understood. Therefore, additional research is needed to explore the role of supplementation in hypoxic conditions. This study was to investigate the effects of caffeine (C), taurine (T), caffeine, and taurine co-ingestion (TC) or placebo (P) on repetitive sprint exercise performance and related physiological responses after exhaustion exercise in team athletes under simulated hypoxic conditions. A double-blind crossover randomized controlled experimental design was employed. 16 male participants (Age:23.69\u2009\u00b1\u20092.15\u00a0years, Body mass: 75.04\u2009\u00b1\u20097.79\u00a0kg, Height:1.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u00a0m) volunteered to receive four different supplement ingestions to complete the exercise tests: (1) placebo (5\u00a0mg/kg maltodextrin), (2) taurine (50\u00a0mg/kg), (3) caffeine (5\u00a0mg/kg), (4) taurine\u2009+\u2009caffeine (50\u00a0mg/kg\u2009+\u20095\u00a0mg/kg). All selected participants were university football players who had undergone rigorous training regimens (85-95% of maximum heart rate, duration of 60\u00a0min, with more than five training sessions per week). All participants completed an exhaustion test and subsequent repetitive sprint exercise in a simulated hypoxic environment (A simulation of a soccer game in sports mode). Time to exhaustion (TTE), peak power (PP), and mean power (MP) were recorded at the end of the exhaustion test and during the repetitive sprint exercise, respectively. This study designed an exercise protocol for repetitive sprinting after exhaustion exercise based on the pattern of play in football. The following variables were monitored throughout the experiments: heart rate (HR), blood lactate (B[La]), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), dyspnea, and rating of perceived exhaustion (RPE). The Stroop Test was administered at three separate time points: pre-test, mid-test, and post-test, throughout the exercise trial. The countermovement jump test (CMJ) was carried out at three specific time points: before the test, 3\u00a0min after the test, and 6\u00a0min after the test. The caffeine (C:618.56\u2009+\u200942.50\u00a0s, p\u2009=\u20090.027, d\u2009=\u20090.996) and taurine\u2009+\u2009caffeine (TC: 613.69\u2009+\u200937.74\u00a0s, p\u2009=\u20090.041, d\u2009=\u20090.902) groups significantly improved time to exhaustion compared to the placebo group. Blood lactate was significantly higher in the taurine\u2009+\u2009caffeine group than in the placebo group after repetitive sprint exercise (P: 9.87\u2009\u00b1\u20091.97, TC: 12.31\u2009\u00b1\u20092.54, p\u2009=\u20090.016). The caffeine group significantly reduced dyspnea, and rating of perceived exhaustion after repetitive sprint exercise (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The taurine (T: 43.42\u2009\u00b1\u20093.46, p\u2009=\u20090.005), caffeine (C: 44.11\u2009\u00b1\u20094.72, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and taurine\u2009+\u2009caffeine (TC: 43.04\u2009\u00b1\u20093.30, p\u2009=\u20090.011) groups all showed an increase in pre-exercise countermovement jump height. The caffeine group significantly reduced the consistent response time (p\u2009=\u20090.023) and inconsistent response time (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in the Stroop Test compared to the placebo group. Caffeine, along with combined taurine, significantly prolonged the duration of exhaustion exercise in a hypoxic environment; however, it did not affect subsequent repetitive sprint performance.

          "title": "Does One Shot Work? The Acute Impact of a Single Taurine Dose on Exercise Performance: A Meta-Analytic Review.",
          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the acute effects of a single dose of taurine supplementation on exercise performance and examined potential moderators related to participant characteristics, exercise modality, dosing, and administration protocols. Six electronic databases were searched up to July 2025, identifying 23 eligible randomized trials (k\u2009=\u200969, N\u2009=\u2009308). A three-level random-effects meta-analysis indicated that acute taurine ingestion may be associated with small-to-moderate improvements in overall performance (g\u2009=\u20090.25, 95% CI [0.10, 0.39], I\u2009=\u200961%). Moderator analyses suggested that benefits were more apparent in males and across aerobic endurance, strength/power, and agility/coordination tasks, whereas evidence for anaerobic capacity and muscular endurance remained inconsistent. No significant dose-response relationship was detected within the commonly used 1-6\u2009g range, suggesting potential threshold effects rather than linear trends. Both capsule and beverage formulations appeared effective, and nonlinear meta-regression indicated that ingestion about 1\u2009h before exercise might yield the most favorable outcomes, although this timing effect was not robust in sensitivity analyses. Further analyses showed that several subgroup effects were attenuated after excluding influential studies, and prediction intervals frequently included the null, reflecting uncertainty in replicability. The overall certainty of evidence, assessed using GRADE, was rated low to very low due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias. Collectively, these findings suggest that acute single-dose taurine supplementation holds promise as an ergogenic aid, but its effectiveness likely varies depending on dosage, blinding procedures, and exercise context. Additional high-quality trials are needed to establish more definitive recommendations.",

          "content": "Despite advances in vitrification techniques for sperm cryopreservation, cryo-damages of sperm caused by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) continue to impede implementation of this technique. This study analyses the effects of taurine and hypotaurine as anti-oxidants during vitrification of human sperms. The study was performed in two steps. In the first step, 20 normospermic semen samples were vitrified in the presence of varying concentrations of taurine and hypotaurine, and their effects as anti-oxidant agents on classical sperm parameters, hyaluronan-binding assay (HBA), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and acrosome reaction (AR) were studied. Statistical analyses showed that the sperm parameters in all vitrified groups decreased significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) compared to the fresh group. However, HBA and acrosome integrity in vitrified groups containing taurine and 50\u202fmM of hypotaurine were better than in the control group (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The morphology of the vitrified group was good only in the group that contained 50\u202fmM of hypotaurine (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Based on the results from the first step, 50\u202fmM of hypotaurine was considered the ideal anti-oxidant formulation and further tests were carried out on 10 normospermic semen samples with this protecting agent. In addition to the mentioned parameters, the expression of heat shock proteinA2 (HSPA2) was studied in the vitrified group with 50\u202fmM hypotaurine, warmed under two different warming temperatures 37 and 42\u202f\u00b0C. 50\u202fmM Hypotaurine was found to equally improve motility, morphology, HBA, and AR after warming at 37\u202f\u00b0C and 42\u202f\u00b0C (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). However, at both warming temperatures, the expression of HSPA2 was reduced in all vitrified groups comparing to the fresh group (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). In conclusion, taurine and hypotaurine antioxidants, especially 50\u202fmM hypotaurine, are able to reduce deleterious cryo-injuries on morphology, acrosome and HBA and improve sperm recovery at both warming temperatures (37 and 42\u202f\u00b0C). However, they do not have any protective action on expression of HSPA2.",

          "content": "Skeletal muscle wasting, associated with aging, may be regulated by the inflammatory cytokines as well as by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). l-carnitine possesses anti-inflammatory properties and increases plasma IGF-1 concentration, leading to the regulation of the genes responsible for protein catabolism and anabolism. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a 24-week l-carnitine supplementation on serum inflammatory markers, IGF-1, body composition and skeletal muscle strength in healthy human subjects over 65 years of age. Women between 65 and 70 years of age were supplemented for 24 weeks with either 1500 mg l-carnitine-l-tartrate or an isonitrogenous placebo per day in a double-blind fashion. Before and after the supplementation protocol, body mass and composition, as well as knee extensor and flexor muscle strength were determined. In the blood samples, free carnitine, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, C-reactive protein and IGF-1 were determined. A marked increase in free plasma carnitine concentration was observed due to l-carnitine supplementation. No substantial changes in other parameters were noted. In the current study, supplementation for 24 weeks affected neither the skeletal muscle strength nor circulating markers in healthy women over 65 years of age. Positive and negative aspects of l-carnitine supplementation need to be clarified.",

A quantity of 2 g of L-carnitine or a placebo were administered orally in random order to these subjects 1 h before they began exercise on a cycle ergometer. Exercise intensity was increased by 50-W increments every 3 min until they became exhausted. After 72-h recovery, the same exercise regime was repeated but this time the subjects, who had previously received L-carnitine, were now given the placebo and vice versa. The results showed that at the maximal exercise intensity, treatment with L-carnitine significantly increased both maximal oxygen uptake, and power output. Moreover, at similar exercise intensities in the L-carnitine trial oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, pulmonary ventilation and plasma lactate were reduced. It is concluded that under these experimental conditions pretreatment with L-carnitine favoured aerobic processes resulting in a more efficient performance. Possible mechanisms producing this effect are discussed.",

Exercise induces health benefits, but acute exertion up-regulates oxidative stress responses in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on i) exercise performance and ii) blood redox status both at rest and after exercise. Twelve hemodialysis patients received either L-carnitine (20 mg kg(-1) i.v.) or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, and crossover design for 8 wk. Participants performed an exercise test to exhaustion before and after supplementation. During the test, V\u02d9O2, respiratory quotient, heart rate, and time to exhaustion were monitored. Blood samples, collected before and after exercise, were analyzed for lactate, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls, reduced and oxidized glutathione, antioxidant capacity, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity. Blood carnitine increased by L-carnitine supplementation proportionately at rest and after exercise. L-carnitine supplementation increased time to fatigue (22%) and decreased postexercise lactate (37%), submaximal heart rate, and respiratory quotient but did not affect V\u02d9O2peak. L-carnitine supplementation increased reduced/oxidized glutathione (2.7-fold at rest, 4-fold postexercise) and glutathione peroxidase activity (4.5% at rest, 10% postexercise) and decreased malondialdehyde (19% at rest and postexercise) and protein carbonyl (27% at rest, 40% postexercise) concentration. Data suggest that a 2-month L-carnitine supplementation may be effective in attenuating oxidative stress responses, enhancing antioxidant status, and improving performance of patients with end-stage renal disease.",

          "content": "A double-blind, cross-over study was designed to evaluate the effects of L-carnitine in patients with peripheral vascular disease. After drug washout, 20 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or L-carnitine (2 g bid, orally) for a period of 3 weeks and were then crossed over to the other treatment for an additional 3 weeks. The effect on walking distance at the end of each treatment period was measured by treadmill test. Absolute walking distance rose from 174 +/- 63 m with placebo to 306 +/- 122 m (p less than .01) with carnitine. Biopsy of the ischemic muscle, carried out before and after 15 days of L-carnitine administration in four additional patients, showed that treatment significantly increased total carnitine levels. An additional goal of this study was to ascertain the effects of L-carnitine on the metabolic changes induced by exercise in the affected limb. In six patients under control conditions, arterial and popliteal venous lactate and pyruvate concentrations were determined at rest, when the maximal walking distance was reached, and 5 min after the walking test. Twenty-four hours later, L-carnitine was administered intravenously (3 g as a bolus followed by an infusion of 2 mg/kg/min for 30 min) and metabolic assessments were repeated. Five minutes after the walking test, popliteal venous lactate concentration increased by 107 +/- 16% before treatment and by only 54 +/- 32% (p less than .01) after carnitine. Furthermore, carnitine induced a more rapid recovery to the resting value of the lactate/pyruvate ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Fifteen eumenorrheic women underwent cycle ergometer exercise at 60% maximal oxygen uptake (V\u0307 O) for 45\u2009min, followed by exercise at an intensity that was increased to 80% V\u0307 O  until exhaustion, during two menstrual cycle phases, including the early follicular phase (FP) and the midluteal phase (LP). The blood levels of estradiol, progesterone, total carnitine, free carnitine, and acylcarnitine were assessed. Compared with the FP, the LP had significantly lower serum total carnitine (p<0.05) and free carnitine (p<0.01). Moreover, the group with decreased endurance performance in the LP than in the FP showed a significantly higher change in serum free carnitine compared with the group that showed improved endurance performance in the LP than in the FP (p<0.05). The results of this study suggested that the changes in serum free carnitine during the menstrual cycle might influence endurance performance.",

Measurements were made on venous blood samples collected during each experiment at fixed time intervals over an initial rest of 45 min, 60 min bicycle exercise performed near 50% VO2max and 120 min recovery. Free and total plasma carnitine levels reached a plateau corresponding to an average rise of 25% for both fractions, 9-10 days after the beginning of the L-carn diet. These levels returned to their initial values 6-8 weeks after cessation of the supply. Generally L-carn supplementation did not significantly modify the physiological parameters and circulating metabolites. No distinct increase of the relative participation of endogenous lipids in the fuel supply of prolonged submaximal exercise was observed. In normal human subjects the increased demand for fatty acid oxidation resulting from exercise seems to be adequately supported by endogenous levels of carnitine.",

          "content": "Haemodialysis patients have impaired exercise tolerance that may be related to impaired carnitine availability and/or alterations in carnitine metabolism. As carnitine metabolism is sex- and age-related, we examined plasma free and esterified carnitine concentrations, muscle strength, and estimated exercise tolerance in female (n=51) and male (n=63) patients of different ages (18-86 years). Concentrations of free carnitine and acetylcarnitine were determined in the plasma of patients. Isometric handgrip strength was measured using a dynamometer while exercise tolerance was predicted from scores for self-reported walking distance on the level and on an incline. Plasma total carnitine concentration in the females was significantly lower than that of males (35.4+/-1.3 and 42.4+/-1.4 micro mol/l, respectively, P<0.01). This was almost entirely due to the lower plasma free carnitine concentration of females when compared with the males (20.6+/-0.9 and 26.3+/-1.1 micro mol/l, respectively, P<0.05). Furthermore, plasma free carnitine concentrations were negatively correlated with age in females (r=-0.45, P<0.001) even when the linear effects of haemoglobin, albumin, body weight, time on dialysis, and muscle strength were removed from the regression analysis (partial correlation coefficient; pcc=-0.43, P=0.018), but not in the males (r=0.03, P>0.05). Isometric handgrip strength and estimated exercise tolerance on the level were lower in females than males (138.9+/-10.9 and 259.0+/-15.2 N, P<0.001; and 3.5+/-0.2 and 4.3+/-0.2, P<0.05, respectively). Isometric handgrip strength and estimated exercise tolerance (walking distance on the level and on an incline) were positively correlated with plasma free carnitine concentrations in females, but not in the males. There was a strong relationship between plasma free carnitine concentrations and age in female patients, but not in males. It is unlikely that the reduction in plasma free carnitine in females was a direct causative factor in their reduced exercise tolerance, but probably reflects greater muscle de-conditioning/atrophy with age in female patients.",

          "content": "This study investigated the effects of L-carnitine supplementation on muscle carnitine and glycogen content during submaximal exercise (EX). Triglycerides were evaluated by a fat feeding (90 g fat) and 3 h later subjects cycled for 60 min at 70% VO2max (CON). Muscle biopsies were obtained preexercise and after 30 and 60 min of EX. Blood samples were taken prior to and every 15 min of exercise. Subjects randomly completed two additional trials following 7 and 14 d of carnitine supplementation (6 g.d-1). During one of the two trials, subjects received 2000 units of heparin 15 min prior to EX to elevate FFA (CNhep); no heparin was administered during the other trial (CN). There were no differences in VO2, respiratory exchange ratio, heart rate, or g.min-1 of CHO and fat oxidized among the three trials. At rest serum total acid soluble (TASC) and free (FC) carnitine increased with supplementation (TASC; CON, 71.3 +/- 2.9; CN, 92.8 +/- 5.4; CNhep, 109.8 +/- 3.5 mumol.l-1) (FC; CON, 44.1 +/- 2.7; CN, 66.1 +/- 5.3; CNhep, 77.1 +/- 4.1 mumol.l-1). During EX, TASC remained stable, while FC decreased and short-chain acylcarnitine (SCAC) increased (P < 0.05). Muscle carnitine concentration at rest was unaffected by supplementation. During EX, muscle TASC did not change, FC decreased, and SCAC increased significantly in all three trials. Pre-EX and post-EX muscle glycogens were not different. Increased availability of serum carnitine does not result in an increase in muscle carnitine content nor does it alter lipid oxidation. It appears that there is an adequate amount of carnitine present within the mitochondria to support lipid oxidation.",

Eighteen cross-country skiers took part in a race in the Alps (average inspired partial pressure of O2 100-110 Torr) that lasted on average 13 h 26 min. Carnitine intake, evaluated for 2 wk before the event, was 50 +/- 4 (SE) mg/day. Muscle (vastus lateralis) total carnitine concentration, measured twice with a 2-yr interval on eight rested subjects, did not change with time (17 vs. 16 mumol/g dry wt, NS) but showed consistent interindividual differences (range 12-22, P = 0.001) with no correlation with intake. After exercise, total muscle carnitine was unaltered (from 17.9 +/- 1.0 at rest to 18.3 +/- 0.8 mumol/g dry wt postexercise in the 15 subjects who completed the race, NS), but muscle free carnitine decreased 20% (from 14.9 +/- 0.8 mumol/g, P = 0.01) and short-chain acylcarnitine increased 108% (from 3.5 +/- 0.4 mumol/g, P = 0.01).

Acetyl-L-carnitine is a substance that may reduce ammonia toxicity. This review assessed the benefits and harms of acetyl-L-carnitine for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. To assess the benefits and harms of acetyl-L-carnitine for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded for randomised clinical trials. We sought additional randomised clinical trials from the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We performed all electronic searches until 10 September 2018. We looked through the reference lists of retrieved publications and review articles, and we searched the FDA and EMA websites. We searched for randomised clinical trials in any setting, recruiting people with hepatic encephalopathy. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared acetyl-L-carnitine plus standard care (e.g. antibiotics, lactulose) versus placebo or no acetyl-L-carnitine plus standard care. We are well aware that by selecting randomised clinical trials, we placed greater focus on potential benefits than on potential harms. We selected randomised clinical trials, assessed risk of bias in eight domains, and extracted data in a duplicate and independent fashion. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using I\u00b2 and D\u00b2 statistics. We subjected our analyses to fixed-effect and random-effects model meta-analyses. We assessed bias risk domains to control systematic errors. We assessed overall quality of the data for each individual outcome by using the GRADE approach. We identified five randomised clinical trials involving 398 participants. All trials included only participants with cirrhosis as the underlying cause of hepatic encephalopathy. Trials included participants with covert or overt hepatic encephalopathy. All trials were conducted in Italy by a single team and assessed acetyl-L-carnitine compared with placebo. Oral intervention was the most frequent route of administration. All trials were at high risk of bias and were underpowered. None of the trials were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.None of the identified trials reported information on all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, or days of hospitalisation. Only one trial assessed quality of life using the Short Form (SF)-36 scale (67 participants; very low-quality evidence). The effects of acetyl-L-carnitine compared with placebo on general health at 90 days are uncertain (MD -6.20 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.51 to -2.89). Results for additional domains of the SF-36 are also uncertain. One trial assessed fatigue using the Wessely and Powell test (121 participants; very low-quality evidence). The effects are uncertain in people with moderate-grade hepatic encephalopathy (mental fatigue: MD 0.40 points, 95% CI -0.21 to 1.01; physical fatigue: MD -0.20 points, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.52) and mild-grade hepatic encephalopathy (mental fatigue: -0.80 points, 95% CI -1.48 to -0.12; physical fatigue: 0.20 points, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.12). Meta-analysis showed a reduction in blood ammonium levels favouring acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo (MD -13.06 mg/dL, 95% CI -17.24 to -8.99; 387 participants; 5 trials; very low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo increases the risk of non-serious adverse events (8/126 (6.34%) vs 3/120 (2.50%); RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.68 to 9.22; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). Overall, adverse events data were poorly reported and harms may have been underestimated. This Cochrane systematic review analysed a heterogeneous group of five trials at high risk of bias and with high risk of random errors conducted by only one research team. We assessed acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo in participants with cirrhosis with covert or overt hepatic encephalopathy. Hence, we have no data on the drug for hepatic encephalopathy in acute liver failure. We found no information about all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, or days of hospitalisation. We found no clear differences in effect between acetyl-L-carnitine and placebo regarding quality of life, fatigue, and non-serious adverse events. Acetyl-L-carnitine reduces blood ammonium levels compared with placebo. We rated all evidence as of very low quality due to pitfalls in design and execution, inconsistency, small sample sizes, and very few events. The harms profile for acetyl-L-carnitine is presently unclear. Accordingly, we need further randomised clinical trials to assess acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo conducted according to the SPIRIT statements and reported according to the CONSORT statements.",

          "content": "Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) often develop malnutrition, which deteriorates after cancer surgery and negatively affects surgical outcomes. Despite being an abundant and versatile amino acid involved in the immune system and metabolic functions, glutamine levels are significantly depleted among patients who are critically ill or hypercatabolic. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether parenteral glutamine supplementation may improve nutritional status and surgical outcomes. This retrospective, single-center cohort study included patients with GA who underwent gastrectomy between January 2007 and June 2019. Patients were classified into either the non-glutamine or glutamine group. Propensity score matching was used to minimize the bias in patient demographics. Furthermore, the average parenteral glutamine dose from the day of surgery to postoperative day four was calculated in g/kg/day. Surgical outcomes (length of hospitalization, major complication, and mortality) and changes in lymphocyte count and serum albumin levels 7 days post-surgery were assessed in both matched groups using adjusted models. A total of 1950 patients were reviewed, among whom 522 (26.8%) received parenteral glutamine supplementation (glutamine dose ranging from 0.05 to 0.49\u00a0g/kg/day). Among the included patients, 57.2% were males, and the median age was 64.9 years. After matching, there were 478 cases in each group. No differences in surgical outcomes and changes in lymphocyte count were observed between both matched groups. The glutamine group exhibited a smaller decrease in serum albumin levels compared to the non-glutamine group (-0.6 vs.\u00a0-1.1\u00a0g/dL; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The adjusted matched model showed that glutamine dose contributed significantly toward increasing serum albumin levels (coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.08 per 0.1\u00a0g/day/kg increment in glutamine; 95% confidence interval: 0.04 to 0.10; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Perioperative parenteral glutamine supplementation had a positive dose-dependent impact on the recovery of serum albumin levels among patients with GA undergoing gastrectomy, implying that glutamine supplementation improved postoperative nutritional suppression and ameliorated stress-associated inflammation. Although glutamine supplementation was not associated with surgical outcomes, further studies should be conducted to evaluate the clinical significance of serum albumin restoration.",

A group of 31 subjects, aged 18-24 years, were randomly allocated to groups (double blind) to receive either glutamine (0.9 g x kg lean tissue mass(-1) x day(-1); n = 17) or a placebo (0.9 g maltodextrin x kg lean tissue mass(-1) x day(-1); n = 14 during 6 weeks of total body resistance training. Exercises were performed for four to five sets of 6-12 repetitions at intensities ranging from 60% to 90% 1 repetition maximum (1 RM). Before and after training, measurements were taken of 1 RM squat and bench press strength, peak knee extension torque (using an isokinetic dynamometer), lean tissue mass (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) and muscle protein degradation (urinary 3-methylhistidine by high performance liquid chromatography). Repeated measures ANOVA showed that strength, torque, lean tissue mass and 3-methylhistidine increased with training (P < 0.05), with no significant difference between groups. Both groups increased their 1 RM squat by approximately 30% and 1 RM bench press by approximately 14%. The glutamine group showed increases of 6% for knee extension torque, 2% for lean tissue mass and 41% for urinary levels of 3-methylhistidine. The placebo group increased knee extension torque by 5%, lean tissue mass by 1.7% and 3-methylhistidine by 56%. We conclude that glutamine supplementation during resistance training has no significant effect on muscle performance, body composition or muscle protein degradation in young healthy adults.",

There is also some evidence that cells of the immune system are less able to mount a defence against infections after such exercise. The level of plasma glutamine, an important fuel for cells of the immune system, is decreased in athletes after endurance exercise; this may be partly responsible for the apparent immunosuppression which occurs in these individuals. We monitored levels of infection in more than 200 runners and towers. The levels of infection were lowest in middle-distance runners, and highest in runners after a full or ultramarathon and in elite rowers after intensive training. In the present study, athletes participating in different types of exercise consumed two drinks, containing either glutamine (Group G) or placebo (Group P) immediately after and 2 h after exercise. They subsequently completed questionnaires (n = 151) about the incidence of infections during the 7 days following the exercise. The percentage of athletes reporting no infections was considerably higher in Group G (81%, n = 72) than in Group P (49%, n = 79, p < 0.001).",

          "content": "Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in human muscle and plasma and is utilised at high rates by rapidly dividing cells, including leucocytes, to provide energy and optimal conditions for nucleotide biosynthesis. As such, it is considered to be essential for proper immune function. During various catabolic states including surgical trauma, infection, starvation and prolonged exercise, glutamine homeostasis is placed under stress. Falls in the plasma glutamine level (normal range 500 to 750 mumol/L after an overnight fast) have been reported following endurance events and prolonged exercise. These levels remain unchanged or temporarily elevated after short term, high intensity exercise. Plasma glutamine has also been reported to fall in patients with untreated diabetes mellitus, in diet-induced metabolic acidosis and in the recovery period following high intensity intermittent exercise. Common factors among all these stress states are rises in the plasma concentrations of cortisol and glucagon and an increased tissue requirement for glutamine for gluconeogenesis. It is suggested that increased gluconeogenesis and associated increases in hepatic, gut and renal glutamine uptake account for the depletion of plasma glutamine in catabolic stress states, including prolonged exercise. The short term effects of exercise on the plasma glutamine level may be cumulative, since heavy training has been shown to result in low plasma glutamine levels (< 500 mumol/L) requiring long periods of recovery. Furthermore, athletes experiencing discomfort from the overtraining syndrome exhibit lower resting levels of plasma glutamine than active healthy controls. Therefore, physical activity directly affects the availability of glutamine to the leucocytes and thus may influence immune function. The utility of plasma glutamine level as a marker of overtraining has recently been highlighted, but a consensus has not yet been reached concerning the best method of determining the level. Since injury, infection, nutritional status and acute exercise can all influence plasma glutamine level, these factors must be controlled and/or taken into consideration if plasma glutamine is to prove a useful marker of impending overtraining.",

          "content": "Glutamine is an amino acid essential for many important homeostatic functions and for the optimal functioning of a number of tissues in the body, particularly the immune system and the gut. However, during various catabolic states, such as infection, surgery, trauma and acidosis, glutamine homeostasis is placed under stress, and glutamine reserves, particularly in the skeletal muscle, are depleted. With regard to glutamine metabolism, exercise stress may be viewed in a similar light to other catabolic stresses. Plasma glutamine responses to both prolonged and high intensity exercise are characterised by increased levels during exercise followed by significant decreases during the post-exercise recovery period, with several hours of recovery required for restoration of pre-exercise levels, depending on the intensity and duration of exercise. If recovery between exercise bouts is inadequate, the acute effects of exercise on plasma glutamine level may be cumulative, since overload training has been shown to result in low plasma glutamine levels requiring prolonged recovery. Athletes suffering from the overtraining syndrome (OTS) appear to maintain low plasma glutamine levels for months or years. All these observations have important implications for organ functions in these athletes, particularly with regard to the gut and the cells of the immune system, which may be adversely affected. In conclusion, if methodological issues are carefully considered, plasma glutamine level may be useful as an indicator of an overtrained state.",

          "content": "Glutamine is an essential substrate for the proper functioning of cells of the immune system. Falls in plasma glutamine concentration after exercise may have deleterious consequences for immune cell function and render the individual more susceptible to infection. The purpose of the present study was to examine changes in plasma glutamine concentration (measured using a validated enzymatic spectrophotometric method) following an acute bout of intermittent high-intensity exercise. Eight well-trained male games players took part in the study. Subjects reported to the laboratory following an overnight fast and performed a 1-h cycle exercise task consisting of 20 1-min periods at 100% maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) each separated by 2 min of recovery at 30% VO2max. Venous blood samples were taken before exercise and at 5 min, 1 h, 2.5 h, 5 h and 24 h post-exercise. Glutamine was measured by enzymatic spectrophotometric determination of the ammonia concentration before and after treatment of the plasma with glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2). Plasma glutamine concentration did not fall in the immediate post-exercise period [pre-exercise 681 (23) microM compared with 663 (46) microM at 5 min post-exercise, mean (SEM)], but fell to 572 (35) microM at 5 h post-exercise (P < 0.05 compared with pre-exercise). Plasma lactate concentration rose to 8.8 (1.0) mM at the end of exercise and fell to 1.8 (0.4) mM at 1 h post-exercise, but plasma concentrations of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate both rose substantially in the post-exercise period (to 240% and 400% of pre-exercise levels, respectively). The circulating leucocyte count increased significantly during exercise (P < 0.01), continued to increase in the hours following exercise and peaked at 2.5 h post-exercise (mainly due to a neutrophilia). The fall in the plasma glutamine concentration at 5 h post-exercise could be due to increased renal uptake of glutamine, which generally occurs in conditions of metabolic acidosis or due to a greater removal of glutamine from the plasma resulting from the elevated circulating leucocyte count.",

To investigate the glutamine responses to progressive endurance training, twenty healthy males were randomly assigned to a training group or a non-exercising control group. The training group performed a progressive (3 to 6 x 90 minute sessions per week at 70 % V.O (2max)) six-week endurance training programme on a cycle ergometer, while the control group did not participate in any exercise during this period. Performance assessments (V.O (2max) and time to exhaustion) and resting blood samples (for haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, cortisol, ferritin, creatine kinase, glutamine, uric acid and urea analysis) were obtained prior to the commencement of training (Pre) and at the end of week 2, week 4 and week 6. The training group showed significant improvements in time to exhaustion (p < 0.01), and V.O (2max) (p < 0.05) at all time points (except week 2 for V.O (2max)), while the control group performance measures did not change. In the training group, haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than pretraining values at week 2 and 4, as percentage changes in plasma volume indicated a significant (p < 0.01) haemodilution (+ 6 - 9 %) was present at week 2, 4 and 6. No changes were seen in the control group. In the training group, plasma glutamine (week 2, 4 and 6), creatine kinase (week 2 and 4), uric acid (week 2 and 4) and urea (week 2 and 4) all increased significantly from pretraining levels. No changes in cortisol or ferritin were found in the training group and no changes in any blood variables were present in the control group. Plasma glutamine was the only blood variable to remain significantly above pretraining (966 +/- 32 micromol . 1 (-1)) levels at week 6 (1176 +/- 24 micromol . 1 (-1); p < 0.05) The elevation seen here in glutamine levels, after 6 weeks of progressive endurance training, is in contrast to previous reports of decreased glutamine concentrations in overtrained athletes. In conclusion, 6 weeks of progressive endurance training steadily increased plasma glutamine levels, which may prove useful in the monitoring of training responses.",

          "content": "A metabolic relation exists between glutamine and arginine, 2 amino acids with properties that enhance the recovery of seriously ill patients. It is possible that glutamine exerts part of its beneficial effects by enhancing the availability of arginine. We aimed to quantify under postabsorptive conditions the metabolic pathway of plasma glutamine into arginine via the intermediate citrulline and to establish the contribution of the kidneys to the synthesis of arginine. The study was conducted in patients during surgery. The metabolism of glutamine, citrulline, and arginine was studied by using intravenous administration of stable isotope tracers of the amino acids. Results were interpreted by using established equations. Parametric tests were used to test and correlate results. P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Mean (+/-SE) whole-body plasma turnover rates of glutamine, citrulline, and arginine were 240 +/- 14, 6.2 +/- 0.6, and 42 +/- 2.9 micromol x kg(-1) x h(-1), respectively (P < 0.01). Plasma turnover of citrulline derived from glutamine was shown to be 5.1 +/- 0.7 micromol x kg(-1) x h(-1), and arginine derived from citrulline was shown to be 4.9 +/- 0.9 micromol x kg(-1) x h(-1) (P < 0.01). The contribution of plasma glutamine to plasma arginine derived from plasma citrulline was calculated to be 64%. The kidneys were observed to take up >50% of circulating plasma citrulline and to release equimolar amounts of arginine into plasma. This study shows that glutamine is an important precursor for the synthesis of arginine in humans. It also provides a firm basis for future studies exploring the effect of a treatment dose and the route of administration (enteral or parenteral) of glutamine.",

This study evaluates the usefulness of perioperative nutrition using HMB/Arg/Gln in patients who were scheduled to undergo open surgery for abdominal malignancies in a randomized controlled trial. Patients scheduled for open surgery for abdominal malignancies were randomized to receive HMB/Arg/Gln (1.2 g HMB, 7 g L-Arg, and 7 g L-Gln) or placebo (isocaloric juice). The supplements were provided once daily for 3 days preoperatively and once daily for 7 days postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the incidence of wound complications. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of other complications, postoperative duration of hospital stay, total-body skeletal muscle mass, handgrip strength, and skin water content. Sixty-one patients were randomly assigned to either the HMB/Arg/Gln (n = 31) or the placebo (n = 30) group. One patient in the HMB/Arg/Gln group was ineligible because laparoscopic surgery was performed; thus, 60 patients were analyzed. The incidence of wound complications (20%) was the same in both groups (P = 1.000). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other complications, body composition, handgrip strength, or skin water content between the 2 groups. Serum growth hormone (GH) levels were significantly higher for patients whose total intake was > 80% of planned volume in the HMB/Arg/Gln group. The incidence of wound complications would not be reduced by perioperative HMB/Arg/Gln administration in patients who underwent open surgery. The efficacy of HMB/Arg/Gln for increasing serum GH levels needs to be validated in another large-scale randomized controlled trial.",

Dietary protein intake of each subject was measured (g.d-1 and g.kg-1.d-1). Plasma glutamine concentration was significantly different between sports (P = 0.000, ANOVA) with mean plasma glutamine concentration of cyclists significantly higher than in all other groups, and mean plasma glutamine concentration of powerlifters and swimmers significantly lower than in cyclists and nonathletes (P < 0.05, post hoc analysis). There was no significant relationship between plasma glutamine concentration and total dietary protein intake when expressed as g.d-1 (r = 0.11, P > 0.05); however, plasma glutamine concentration and dietary protein relative to body mass (g.kg-1.d-1) were significantly inversely correlated (r = -0.37, P = 0.007).

          "content": "The aim of this study was to establish the pattern and time course of plasma glutamine recovery after acute, high-intensity exercise in well-trained swimmers. In Study 1, elite male swimmers (n=8) performed 15 x 100 m swimming intervals (ITS) at 70% and 95% of maximal 100m freestyle time. Resting plasma glutaminle levels were determined on a nonexercise control day (0% ITS). Venous blood samples were obtained prior to, immediately afte;, and 30, 60, 120, and 150 mini postexercise. In Study 2, the 95% ITS was repeated in elite male swuimmers (n=8), while control subjects (n=8) did not exercise, to test for any diurnal variation in plasma glutamine levels. Venous blood samples were obtained prior to and 2, 4, 6, and 8 h postexercise. In Study 1, no change was observed in plasma glutamine following the 0% (control) and 70% ITS, but following the 95% ITS glutamine decreased significantly (p < 0.01) over the recovery period. In Study 2, plasma glutamine again decreased over the recovery period in the swimmers, but no changes were observed in the controls. It was concluded that intensive swim traininlg results in postexercise decreases in plasma glutamine levels. Because glutamine has been suggested as a marker of overtraining, a need to measure glutaminle at standard times within training programs is indicated.",

          "content": "Exogenous glutamine supplement is known to improve morbidity and mortality of critically-ill patients. This study was conducted to elucidate the role of glutamine in minimally invasive surgery. We retrospectively reviewed subtotal gastrectomy patients in National Taiwan University Hospital from Dec 2005 to Dec 2008. The patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 underwent subtotal gastrectomy by laparotomy without glutamine supplement, group 2 underwent subtotal gastrectomy by laparotomy with glutamine supplement and group 3 underwent gasless laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy with parenteral glutamine supplement. There were 155 patients in total; 85 patients in group 1, 17 in group 2 and 53 in group 3. The mean flatus days after operation are 3.6, 3.1 and 2.8 for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (p=0.001). Oral intake after operation was commenced after 6.7, 5.0 and 4.7 days (p=0.006). The body temperature had borderline differences between groups 3 and 1. There were significant differences in postoperative systemic responses including heart rates (p<0.001) and tenderness (p=0.011) 5 days after operation for group 3 vs. group 1. Minimally invasive surgery was a negative factor for postoperative body temperature change. Glutamine was a significant factor for postoperative heart rate change and reduction of tenderness. Glutamine supplement may have synergic effects of rapid recovery in minimal invasive surgery for subtotal gastrectomy patients by minimizing the postoperative systemic response and accelerating recovery.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of intravenous glutamine supplementation on short-term postoperative outcomes in these patients. This retrospective study included patients with RC who received NT and underwent radical surgery between January 2013 and July 2022 and were either administered glutamine (glutamine group) or not administered glutamine (non-glutamine group). Propensity score matching method was used to analyze and compare postoperative complications and other outcome indicators. A total of 208 patients were reviewed, and 53 were included in each group post matching. While no significant difference in the time to first solid food intake between the two groups was observed, the glutamine group had a significantly reduced incidence of postoperative complications, shorter length of hospital stay, and shorter time to first defecation, first exhaust, and first fluid diet intake than those of the control group. Moreover, glutamine alleviated the reduction in albumin and prealbumin levels. Perioperative parenteral glutamine supplementation effectively reduces the incidence of postoperative complications, promotes postoperative recovery, and improves albumin levels in patients undergoing RC surgery and receiving NT.",

          "content": "Whey protein and leucine ingestion following exercise increases muscle protein synthesis and could influence neutrophil function during recovery from prolonged intense exercise. We examined the effects of whey protein and leucine ingestion post-exercise on neutrophil function and immunomodulators during a period of intense cycling. In a randomized double-blind crossover, 12 male cyclists ingested protein/leucine/carbohydrate/fat (LEUPRO 20/7.5/89/22 g h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric carbohydrate/fat control (CON 119/22 g h(-1)) beverages for 1-3 h post-exercise during 6 days of high-intensity training. Blood was taken pre- and post-exercise on days 1, 2, 4 and 6 for phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated neutrophil superoxide (O2 (-)) production, immune cell counts, amino acid and lipid metabolism via metabolomics, hormones (cortisol, testosterone) and cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-10). During recovery on day 1, LEUPRO ingestion increased mean concentrations of plasma amino acids (glycine, arginine, glutamine, leucine) and myristic acid metabolites (acylcarnitines C14, myristoylcarnitine; and C14:1-OH, hydroxymyristoleylcarnitine) with neutrophil priming capacity, and reduced neutrophil O2 production (15-17 mmol O2 (-) cell(-1) \u00b1 90 % confidence limits 20 mmol O2 (-) cell(-1)). On day 2, LEUPRO increased pre-exercise plasma volume (6.6 \u00b1 3.8 %) but haematological effects were trivial. LEUPRO supplementation did not substantially alter neutrophil elastase, testosterone, or cytokine concentrations. By day 6, however, LEUPRO reduced pre-exercise cortisol 21 % (\u00b115 %) and acylcarnitine C16 (palmitoylcarnitine) during exercise, and increased post-exercise neutrophil O2 (-) (33 \u00b1 20 mmol O2 (-) cell(-1)), relative to control. Altered plasma amino acid and acylcarnitine concentrations with protein-leucine feeding might partly explain the acute post-exercise reduction in neutrophil function and increased exercise-stimulated neutrophil oxidative burst on day 6, which could impact neutrophil-dependent processes during recovery from intense training.",

Visceral adipose tissue significantly decreased in the intervention group compared to the placebo group at 60 days \u22120.69 g (95% CI: \u22121.09, 0.29) vs. 0.27 g (95% CI: \u22120.11, 0.65), groups difference \u22120.96 (95% CI: \u22121.52, 0.39, p = 0.001). A statistically significant increase in levels of valine, leucine, isoleucine, and total amino acid profiles was observed in the intervention group compared with the placebo group at 60 days (p = 0.001). When taken together, these beneficial effects may be attributed to the innovative composition of this special medical-purpose food which could be considered for the treatment of sarcopenia in the elderly.",

          "content": "This study aimed to determine the effect of postexercise protein-leucine coingestion with CHO-lipid on subsequent high-intensity endurance performance and to investigate candidate mechanisms using stable isotope methods and metabolomics. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 male cyclists ingested a leucine/protein/CHO/fat supplement (LEUPRO 7.5/20/89/22 g \u00b7 h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric CHO/fat control (119/22 g \u00b7 h(-1)) 1-3 h after exercise during a 6-d training block (intense intervals, recovery, repeated-sprint performance rides). Daily protein intake was clamped at 1.9 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (LEUPRO) and 1.5 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (control). Stable isotope infusions (1-(13)C-leucine and 6,6-(2)H2-glucose), mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and nitrogen balance methods were used to determine the effects of LEUPRO on whole-body branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and glucose metabolism and protein turnover. After exercise, LEUPRO increased BCAA levels in plasma (2.6-fold; 90% confidence limits = \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and urine (2.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.2) and increased products of BCAA metabolism plasma acylcarnitine C5 (3.0-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 0.9) and urinary leucine (3.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.3) and \u03b2-aminoisobutyrate (3.4-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.4), indicating that ingesting ~10 g leucine per hour during recovery exceeds the capacity to metabolize BCAA. Furthermore, LEUPRO increased leucine oxidation (5.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and nonoxidative disposal (4.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and left leucine balance positive relative to control. With the exception of day 1 (LEUPRO = 17 \u00b1 20 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = -90 \u00b1 44 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)), subsequent (days 2-5) nitrogen balance was positive for both conditions (LEUPRO = 130 \u00b1 110 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = 111 \u00b1 86 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)). Compared with control feeding, LEUPRO lowered the serum creatine kinase concentration by 21%-25% (90% confidence limits = \u00b1 14%), but the effect on sprint power was trivial (day 4 = 0.4% \u00b1 1.0%, day 6 = -0.3% \u00b1 1.0%). Postexercise protein-leucine supplementation saturates BCAA metabolism and attenuates tissue damage, but effects on subsequent intense endurance performance may be inconsequential under conditions of positive daily nitrogen balance.",

The objective was to examine the effect of a high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement on muscle mass preservation during intentional weight loss in obese older adults. We included 80 obese older adults in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. During a 13-wk weight loss program, all subjects followed a hypocaloric diet (-600 kcal/d) and performed resistance training 3\u00d7/wk. Subjects were randomly allocated to a high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement including a mix of other macro- and micronutrients (150 kcal, 21 g protein; 10\u00d7/wk, intervention group) or an isocaloric control. The primary outcome was change in appendicular muscle mass. The secondary outcomes were body composition, handgrip strength, and physical performance. Data were analyzed by using ANCOVA and mixed linear models with sex and baseline value as covariates. At baseline, mean \u00b1 SD age was 63 \u00b1 5.6 y, and body mass index (in kg/m(2)) was 33 \u00b1 4.4. During the trial, protein intake was 1.11 \u00b1 0.28 g \u00b7 kg body weight(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) in the intervention group compared with 0.85 \u00b1 0.24 g \u00b7 kg body weight(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) in the control group (P < 0.001). Both intervention and control groups decreased in body weight (-3.4 \u00b1 3.6 kg and -2.8 \u00b1 2.8 kg; both P < 0.001) and fat mass (-3.2 \u00b1 3.1 kg and -2.5 \u00b1 2.4 kg; both P < 0.001), with no differences between groups. The 13-wk change in appendicular muscle mass, however, was different in the intervention and control groups [+0.4 \u00b1 1.2 kg and -0.5 \u00b1 2.1 kg, respectively; \u03b2 = 0.95 kg (95% CI: 0.09, 1.81); P = 0.03]. Muscle strength and function improved over time without significant differences between groups. A high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement compared with isocaloric control preserves appendicular muscle mass in obese older adults during a hypocaloric diet and resistance exercise program and might therefore reduce the risk of sarcopenia. This trial was registered at the Dutch Trial Register (http://www.trialregister.nl) as NTR2751.",

Thirteen recreationally active men (mean \u00b1 SD: 177.5 \u00b1 6.1\u00a0cm, 75.9 \u00b1 4.6\u00a0kg, 23 \u00b1 3 years, 12.0 \u00b1 5.1% body fat) completed a best effort 20-km cycling time-trial, followed 15\u00a0min later by a Wingate power cycle test, after supplementing with either KCT (approximately 7\u00a0g of beta-hydroxybutyrate, approximately 120\u00a0mg of caffeine, 2.1\u00a0g of leucine, and 2.7\u00a0g of taurine), KT (i.e.,\u00a0same supplement without caffeine), or isoenergetic CHO-PLAC (11\u00a0g of dextrose).

Our goal was to compile data from the available studies in the literature to explore the effect of leucine supplementation on parameters associated with sarcopenia in elderly individuals.  The meta-analysis included older persons over 65 years of age who were recruited on the basis of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People sarcopenia criteria. Studies that were included were those in which at least one sarcopenia criterion was measured, including grip strength, appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height, gait speed, and the short physical performance battery index.  The meta-analysis included ten randomized controlled trials and one prospective study. The leucine group included 566 participants, whereas the placebo group included 567 patients. Patients receiving leucine and patients receiving a placebo had significantly different handgrip ( = 0.03), appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height ( = 0.0.2), and gait speed ( = 0.008). Patients received a high dosage of leucine, and there was a significant difference in the appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height ( = 0.02) and gait speed ( = 0.01) between the high dosage of the leucine group and the control group. When vitamin D was combined with leucine, the appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height ( = 0.03) significantly differed between the leucine group receiving vitamin D and the control group.  Low-quality evidence was found that older sarcopenic patients receiving leucine may show trends toward improved skeletal muscle strength, skeletal muscle quality, and physical performance. The capacity of leucine supplementation to have a beneficial therapeutic impact in older sarcopenic individuals is restricted when it is used alone without concurrent additional therapy.",

          "content": "The primary objective of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available literature relating to leucine supplementation in the elderly with respect to its effects on anthropometrical parameters and muscle strength. The secondary aim was to perform a selective subgroup analysis when possible differentiating between healthy and sarcopenic subjects. Literature search was performed using the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, SportDiscus, and the Cochrane Central Register of trials with restrictions to randomized controlled trials or studies following a cross-over design. Parameters taken into account were body weight, body mass index, lean body mass, fat mass, percentage of body fat, hand grip strength, and knee extension strength. Moreover, biomarkers of glucose metabolism (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, albumin, and HOMA index) were extracted when possible. For each outcome measure of interest, a meta-analysis was performed in order to determine the pooled effect of the intervention in terms of weighted mean differences between the post-intervention (or differences in means) values of the leucine and the respective control groups. Data analysis was performed using the Review Manager 5.2.4. software. A total of 16 studies enrolling 999 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Compared with control groups, leucine supplementation significantly increased gain in body weight [mean differences 1.02 kg, 95%-CI (0.19, 1.85), p=0.02], lean body mass [mean differences 0.99 kg, 95%-CI (0.43, 1.55), p=0.0005], and body mass index [mean differences 0.33 kg/m2, 95%-CI (0.13, 0.53), p=0.001], when compared to the respective control groups. With respect to body weight and lean body mass, leucine supplementation turned out to be more effective in the subgroup of study participants with manifested sarcopenia. All other parameters under investigation were not affected by leucine supplementation in a fashion significantly different from controls. It is concluded that leucine supplementation was found to exert beneficial effects on body weight, body mass index, and lean body mass in older persons in those subjects already prone to sarcopenia, but not muscle strength. However, due to the heterogeneity between the trials included in this systematic review, further studies adopting a homogenous design with respect to participant characteristics duration as well as the kind and amount of daily supplement in use are required.",

          "content": "Age-related strength and muscle mass loss is further increased after acute periods of inactivity. To avoid this, resistance training has been proposed as an effective countermeasure, but the additional effect of a protein supplement is not so clear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a whey protein supplement enriched with leucine after resistance training on muscle mass and strength gains in a post-hospitalized elderly population. A total of 28 participants were included and allocated to either protein supplementation or placebo supplementation following resistance training for 12 weeks (2 days/week). Physical function (lower and upper body strength, aerobic capacity and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test), mini nutritional assessment (MNA) and body composition (Dual X-ray Absorptiometry) were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of resistance training. Both groups showed improvements in physical function after the intervention ( < 0.01), but there were no further effects for the protein group ( > 0.05). Muscle mass did not improve after resistance training in either group ( > 0.05). In conclusion, 12 weeks of resistance training are enough to improve physical function in a post-hospitalized elderly population with no further benefits for the protein-supplemented group.",

Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2014-2018 were used. Overall, 4852 participants aged \u226565 years were included in the study. Demographic, lifestyle, and health data were obtained through interviews and questionnaires. The 24-h recall method was used to assess dietary intake. An amino acid database was established using the 9th revision of the Korean Standard Food Composition Table. The mean handgrip strength was estimated from triplicate measurements obtained using the dominant hand. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between BCAA intake and handgrip strength. Grains greatly contributed to amino acid intake; however, a significant negative association was observed between handgrip strength and increased BCAA intake through grains. In the fully adjusted model, leucine intake and handgrip strength showed a positive association. Thus, consuming BCAAs (especially leucine) via a variety of food sources can help maintain muscle health in older people.",

Outcomes investigated were: total body mass (TBM), FFM, fat mass (FM), total single repetition maximum (1RM), bench press (BP) 1RM, and lower body (LwB) 1RM. Databases consulted were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (Embase), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SportDiscus. Fourteen studies fit the inclusion criteria; however, 11 were analyzed after data extraction and funnel plot analysis exclusion. A total of 302 participants (18-45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 248 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes. We conclude that HMB produces a small effect on TBM gain, but this effect does not translate into significantly greater increases in FFM, strength or decreases in FM during periods of RET. Our findings do not support the use of HMB aiming at improvement of body composition or strength with RET.",

Effects of L-leucine supplementation and resistance training on adipokine markers in untrained perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. J Strength Cond Res 38(3): 526-532, 2024-This study examined the effects of supplementing 5 g of leucine compared with a placebo during a 10-week resistance training program on body composition parameters and adipokine concentrations in untrained, perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Thirty-five women were randomly assigned to 2 groups-leucine (LEU, n = 17) and placebo (PLC, n = 18)-in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Each group consumed the supplement or placebo every day and completed a resistance training program for 10 weeks. Using 3-day food records, a diet was assessed before the intervention and after its cessation. Body composition was assessed preintervention and postintervention using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Moreover, the concentrations of adipokines, such as adiponectin, visfatin, leptin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), were assessed preintervention and postintervention. Both groups showed an increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area ( p = 0.030) and fat-free mass (FFM; p = 0.023). There were significant group differences in concentrations of visfatin ( p = 0.020) and leptin ( p = 0.038) between the PLC and LEU groups. Visfatin displayed higher concentrations in the PLC group and leptin displayed higher concentrations in the LEU group. In addition, there were significant decreases in adiponectin concentrations for both groups (LEU: 652 \u00b1 513 to 292 \u00b1 447 pg\u00b7ml -1 ; PLC: 584 \u00b1 572 to 245 \u00b1 356 pg\u00b7ml -1 , p = 0.002) and MCP-1 only decreased in the PLC group (253 \u00b1 119 to 206 \u00b1 106 pg\u00b7ml -1 , p = 0.004). There were significant decreases in adiponectin concentrations in both groups and a decrease in MCP-1 concentrations in the PLC group. These decreases may be due to both adipokines possible relationship with VAT area. However, it is not known whether leucine has underlying properties that hinder changes in MCP-1 concentrations.",

          "content": "Betaine supplementation, a dietary practice that possesses potential effects on exercise performance, has undergone extensive study. This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse betaine supplementation's effects on exercise performance. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, focusing on studies comparing chronic betaine to a placebo in healthy humans aged 15-60\u2009years, measuring exercise outcomes. Studies with acute betaine supplementation, no control group, or animals were excluded. Quality assessment was done using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and a random-effects model was employed for the meta-analysis. The review included 17 studies with 317 participants (21% female). The results revealed a significant effect size of 0.47 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.89) for maximal strength (1RM, 3RM, maximal isokinetic or isometric force), particularly in the lower body (SMD: 0.49, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.98). No significant effects were found for upper body strength, cycling sprint power, bench press throws power, or muscular endurance. However, vertical jumping performance improved significantly (SMD: 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.69) after excluding a low-quality study. In conclusion, betaine supplementation for at least 7\u2009days significantly enhances muscular strength, especially lower body strength, and shows potential in improving vertical jumping performance.",

          "content": "Various nutritional strategies are adopted for athletes to maintain and to improve performance during the competition season. Betaine may enhance performance during a competitive season by increasing the testosterone to cortisol ratio and reducing systemic inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of betaine supplementation on the bio-motor abilities in young professional soccer players. Twenty-nine young professional soccer players (age, 15.5\u00b10.3 years) were matched by position and randomly assigned to one of two groups for 14 weeks: betaine (BG, 2\u00a0g/day; n=14) or placebo (PG n=15). Diet was standardized by a nutritionist, and measures of muscular power (countermovement jump: CMJ), change of direction: modified 5-0-5), acceleration (10\u00a0m sprint), sprint performance (30\u00a0m sprint time: SpT), muscular strength (leg press and bench press one repetition maximum: 1-RM), repeated sprint ability (running-based anaerobic sprint test: RAST), and aerobic capacity (30-15 intermittent fitness test) were assessed in the pre (P1), mid (P2) and post (P3) season over the course of 5 days. All subjects participated in one soccer match and five training sessions per week. Significant (p < 0.05) group x time interactions were found for maximal oxygen uptake (VO), anaerobic peak power, and muscular strength favoring BG at P2 and P3 compared to P1. There were meaningful (p < 0.05) group x time interactions for CMJ, SpT, and peak power during the RAST that favored the BG. 14-week of betaine supplementation increased predicted 1-RM, VO, and repeated sprint ability performance in youth professional soccer players. Betaine supplementation seems to be a useful nutritional strategy to improve and to maintain performance during a competitive soccer season.",

          "content": "This study examined the effects of 2 weeks of betaine versus placebo supplementation (3 g/d) on 60 km cycling performance, gut permeability, and shifts in plasma metabolites. Participants included 21 male and female non-elite cyclists. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design was used with two 2-week supplementation periods and a 2-week washout period. Supplementation periods were followed by a 60 km cycling time trial. Six blood samples were collected before and after supplementation (overnight fasted state), and at 0 h, 1.5 h, 3 h, and 24 h post-exercise. Five-hour urine samples were collected pre-supplementation and post-60 km cycling after ingesting a sugar solution containing lactulose 5 g, C mannitol 100 mg, and C mannitol 1.9 g in 450 mL water. Other outcome measures included plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein-1 (I-FABP), muscle damage biomarkers (serum creatine kinase, myoglobin), serum cortisol, complete blood cell counts, and shifts in plasma metabolites using untargeted metabolomics. The time to complete the 60 km cycling bout differed significantly between the betaine and placebo trials (mean \u00b1 SE, 112.8 \u00b1 2.3, 114.2 \u00b1 2.6 min, respectively, (-1.41 \u00b1 0.7 min) (effect size = 0.475,  = 0.042). No trial differences were found for I-FABP (interaction effect,  = 0.076), L:CM ( = 0.559), the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio ( = 0.171), serum cortisol ( = 0.982), serum myoglobin ( = 0.942), or serum creatine kinase ( = 0.694). Untargeted metabolomics showed that 214 metabolites exhibited significant trial treatment effects and 130 significant trial x time interaction effects. Betaine versus placebo supplementation was linked to significant increases in plasma betaine, dimethylglycine (DMG), sarcosine, methionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), alpha-ketoglutaramate, and 5'methylthioadensone (MTA), and decreases in plasma carnitine and numerous acylcarnitines. Betaine supplementation modestly improved 60 km cycling performance but had no effect on gut permeability. The metabolomics data supported a strong influence of 2-week intake of betaine on the one-carbon metabolism pathway during the 24 h recovery period.",

The effects of chronic betaine supplementation on exercise performance, skeletal muscle oxygen saturation, and associated biochemical parameters in resistance trained men. J Strength Cond Res 25(12): 3461-3471, 2011-We examined the effects of chronic betaine supplementation on exercise performance and associated parameters in resistance trained men. Men were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner using a crossover design to consume betaine (2.5 g of betaine mixed in 500 ml of Gatorade\u00ae) or a placebo (500 ml of Gatorade\u00ae) for 14 days, with a 21-day washout period. Before and after each treatment period, tests of lower- and upper-body muscular power and isometric force were conducted, including a test of upper-body muscular endurance (10 sets of bench press exercise to failure). Muscle tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) during the bench press protocol was measured via near infrared spectroscopy. Blood samples were collected before and after the exercise test protocol for analysis of lactate, nitrate/nitrite (NOx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). When analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance, no significant differences were noted between conditions for exercise performance variables (p > 0.05). However, an increase in total repetitions (p = 0.01) and total volume load (p = 0.02) in the 10-set bench press protocol was noted with betaine supplementation (paired t-tests), with values increasing approximately 6.5% from preintervention to postintervention. Although not of statistical significance (p = 0.14), postexercise blood lactate increased to a lesser extent with betaine supplementation (210%) compared with placebo administration (270%). NOx was lower postintervention as compared with preintervention (p = 0.06), and MDA was relatively unchanged. The decrease in StO2 during the bench press protocol was greater with betaine vs. placebo (p = 0.01), possibly suggesting enhanced muscle oxygen consumption. These findings indicate that betaine supplementation results in a moderate increase in total repetitions and volume load in the bench press exercise, without favorably impacting other performance measures.",

Three 10\u2009s sprint tests were then completed against a resistance of 7.5% of body mass, separated by 2.5\u2009min of recovery. The study comprised 3 phases: (a) pre-supplementation, (b) randomization to supplement for 2-weeks with either 2.4\u2009g/day BET or placebo (parallel design), and (c) post-supplementation. Repeated-measures analysis of variance were conducted to determine interactions or main effects. There were no group differences for substrate oxidation rates (\u2009>\u20090.05). Although body composition improved pre-post for both groups (\u2009<\u20090.05), only the BET group experienced a significant increase in fat free mass (\u2009<\u20090.01; \u223c3%). Further, only the BET group experienced improvements to performance such as a higher mean power output during the final sprint (\u2009=\u20090.02; \u223c3%) and a lower RPE during the final stage of the graded exercise test (\u2009=\u20090.02).

It was shown that Bet enhanced, while Arg reduced both the stability of \u03b1B-crystallin and its adsorption capacity (AC) to the target protein at the stage of aggregate growth. Thus, the anti-aggregation activity of \u03b1B-crystallin increased in the presence of Bet and decreased under the influence of Arg, which resulted in inhibition or acceleration of Ph aggregation, respectively. Our data show that chemical chaperones can influence the tertiary and quaternary structure of both the target protein and the protein chaperone. The presence of the substrate protein also affects the quaternary structure of \u03b1B-crystallin, causing its disassembly. This is inextricably linked to the anti-aggregation activity of \u03b1B-crystallin, which in turn affects its PPI with the target protein. Thus, our studies contribute to understanding the mechanism of interaction between chaperones and proteins.",

          "content": "Betaine supplementation has been shown to improve body composition and some metrics of muscular performance in young men; but, whether betaine enhances body composition or performance in female subjects is currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between resistance training adaptation and chronic betaine supplementation in females. Twenty-three young women (21.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u00a0years, 165.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u00a0cm, 68.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8\u00a0kg) without prior structured resistance training experience volunteered for this study. Body composition (BodPod), rectus femoris muscle thickness (B-mode Ultrasound), vertical jump, back squat 1RM and bench press 1RM were assessed pre- and post-training. Following 1\u00a0week of familiarization training, subjects were matched for body composition and squat strength, and randomly assigned to either a betaine (2.5\u00a0g/day; n\u2009=\u200911) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200912) group that completed 3 sets of 6-7 exercises per day performed to momentary muscular failure. Training was divided into two lower and one upper body training sessions per week performed on non-consecutive days for 8\u00a0weeks, and weekly volume load was used to analyze work capacity. Significant main effects of time were found for changes in lean mass (2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u00a0kg), muscle thickness (0.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u00a0cm), vertical jump (1.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u00a0cm), squat 1RM (39.8\u2009\u00b1\u200914.0\u00a0kg), and bench press 1 RM (9.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\u00a0kg); however, there were no significant interactions. A trend (p\u2009=\u2009.056) was found for greater weekly training volumes for betaine versus placebo. Significant interactions were found for changes in body fat percentage and fat mass: body fat percentage and fat mass decreased significantly more in betaine (-\u20093.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7%; -\u20092.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u00a0kg) compared to placebo (-\u20091.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6%; -\u20090.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u00a0kg), respectively. The results of this study indicated that betaine supplementation may enhance reductions in fat mass, but not absolute strength, that accompany a resistance training program in untrained collegiate females.",

          "content": "Neural tube defects (NTD) are common malformations resulting from incomplete closure of the neural tube in the first month after conception. Since genetic deficiencies in folate-dependent homocysteine metabolism have been identified in NTD families, we investigated a common variant in betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), 742G-->A (R239Q), as a genetic modifier of NTD risk. Genotypes, nutrient levels, and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) were assessed in 54 patients with spina bifida, 57 mothers of patients, 93 control children, and 86 mothers of controls. The QQ genotype (present in 17% and 7% of the control and case mothers, respectively, and in 12% and 6% of the control and case children, respectively) was associated with a decreased risk of NTD (odds ratios of 0.52 (95% CI 0.13-2.05) for children and 0.37 (95% CI 0.11-1.22) for mothers). The small sample size limited the statistical power of the analyses, but these decreases, although not statistically significant, are compatible with a protective effect. We did not observe statistically-significant genotype-dependent differences in plasma homocysteine, although women with the QQ genotype did have lower homocysteine; in children, the mean homocysteine level was higher in the QQ group. This inconsistency could be explained by the fact that age is a strong determinant of homocysteine in children and the QQ group was on average older than the other genotype groups. Our study suggests that the Q allele of the R239Q mutation may decrease risk of the condition. This warrants further investigation of its relationship with the development of NTD.",

Sleep (22:30-06:30 h) was assessed via actimetry, and either a control (no tablets, NoPill), dextrose placebo (PLAC) or ZMA was ingested 30-60 min before retiring to bed for two nights. The participants undertook the three conditions (NoPill, PLAC or ZMA) administered in a counterbalanced order. The data were analyzed using general linear models with repeated measures. In healthy active males who consume diets of adequate micronutrients, sleep normally and maintain good sleep hygiene (time to bed and wake times), ZMA supplementation had no beneficial effect on RSP or performance in the Stroop test ( > 0.05) but did improve CMJ height ( < 0.001) compared to that of PLAC but not NoPill ( > 0.05). Supplementation of ZMA for two nights had no effect on sleep, RSP or cognitive function. The NoPill condition elucidated the effects of the intervention under investigation.",

Although some manufacturers claim T. terrestris will not lead to a positive drug test, others have suggested that T. terrestris may increase the urinary testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) ratio, which may place athletes at risk of a positive drug test. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of T. terrestris on strength, fat free mass, and the urinary T/E ratio during 5 weeks of preseason training in elite rugby league players. Twenty-two Australian elite male rugby league players (mean +/- SD; age = 19.8 +/- 2.9 years; weight = 88.0 +/- 9.5 kg) were match-paired and randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to either a T. terrestris (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11) group. All subjects performed structured heavy resistance training as part of the club's preseason preparations. A T. terrestris extract (450 mg.d(-1)) or placebo capsules were consumed once daily for 5 weeks. Muscular strength, body composition, and the urinary T/E ratio were monitored prior to and after supplementation. After 5 weeks of training, strength and fat free mass increased significantly without any between-group differences. No between-group differences were noted in the urinary T/E ratio. It was concluded that T. terrestris did not produce the large gains in strength or lean muscle mass that many manufacturers claim can be experienced within 5-28 days. Furthermore, T. terrestris did not alter the urinary T/E ratio and would not place an athlete at risk of testing positive based on the World Anti-Doping Agency's urinary T/E ratio limit of 4:1.",

          "content": "L. contains compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but its effects on exercise-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses are unclear. The aim of this study was to examine whether  L. supplementation can attenuate oxidative stress and inflammatory responses to acute aerobic exercise and improve DOMS. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design study, thirteen healthy men received either a daily supplement of  L. or a placebo for 4\u2009weeks (2-week wash-out period between trials). Before and after the supplementation periods, participants performed an exercise test to exhaustion (75% VOmax). DOMS, thigh girth, and knee joint range of motion (KJRM) were assessed before and after the exercise (2, 24, and 48\u2009h). Blood samples were analyzed for reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, GSH/GSSG ratio, protein carbonyls, total antioxidant capacity, creatine kinase activity, white blood cell count, and TBARS. Acute exercise to exhaustion induced inflammatory responses and changed the blood redox status in both Tribulus and Placebo groups (\u2009<\u20090.050).  L. improved GSH fall (\u2009=\u20090.005), GSSG rise (\u2009=\u20090.001) and maintained a higher level of GSH/GSSG ratio at the 2\u2009h point (\u2009=\u20090.034). TBARS were lowered, protein carbonyls, creatine kinase activity, and white blood cell count elevation diminished significantly (\u2009<\u20090.050).  L. administration did not affect DOMS, thigh girth, or KJRM (\u2009>\u20090.050). 4-weeks of  L. supplementation effectively attenuates oxidative stress responses but cannot improve DOMS.",

A total of 104 women were randomly assigned to receive 94mg, three times/day (TT3) or 280mg once/day for 90 days (TT1). Evaluation was performed using FSFI and QS-F questionnaires, serum levels of prolactin, TSH, total testosterone and SHBG, and clitoral artery assessment with Power Doppler ultrasound. FSFI results demonstrated an improvement in all domains in both groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05) except for the \"Satisfaction\" in the TT3 premenopausal group. QS-F results showed a significant improvement in the mean total score in women of both reproductive phases, for both groups. Postmenopausal patients improved in all sexual domains, except for \"orgasm\" in the TT1 group. PI of the clitoral artery showed no difference in both reproductive phases, in both groups. We conclude that TTerrestris can be a safe alternative for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in pre and postmenopausal women as it is effective in reducing the symptoms with no side effects. Moreover, its use, increased total, free and bioavailable testosterone.",

Subjects performed 3 days of resistance training per week for 8 weeks. Each day during Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, subjects consumed either placebo (PL; n = 10) or a supplement (ANDRO-6; n = 10), which contained daily doses of 300 mg androstenedione, 150 mg DHEA, 750 mg Tribulus terrestris, 625 mg Chrysin, 300 mg Indole-3-carbinol, and 540 mg Saw palmetto. Serum androstenedione concentrations were higher in ANDRO-6 after 2, 5, and 8 weeks (p <.05), while serum concentrations of free and total testosterone were unchanged in both groups. Serum estradiol was elevated at Weeks 2, 5, and 8 in ANDRO-6 (p <.05), and serum estrone was elevated at Weeks 5 and 8 (p <.05). Muscle strength increased (p <.05) similarly from Weeks 0 to 4, and again from Weeks 4 to 8 in both treatment groups. The acute effect of one third of the daily dose of ANDRO-6 and PL was studied in 10 men (23 +/- 4 years). Serum androstenedione concentrations were elevated (p <.05) in ANDRO-6 from 150 to 360 min after ingestion, while serum free or total testosterone concentrations were unchanged. These data provide evidence that the addition of these herbal extracts to androstenedione does not result in increased serum testosterone concentrations, reduce the estrogenic effect of androstenedione, and does not augment the adaptations to resistance training.",

          "content": "Water contamination due to radionuclides is considered a crucial environmental issue. In this study, Tribulus terrestris plant biomass was used as a precursor for obtaining biochar (BC), that was further modified by two different methods using FeCl to obtain two different magnetic biochars. Both (one-step biochar, called 1S-BC, and two-steps biochar, called 2S-BC) were studied to investigate their capability for adsorbing/removing uranium (VI) from aqueous solutions. The U(VI) removal efficacy of both biochars was tested for different values of pH, ionic strength, initial concentration of U(VI) and temperature. Experimental adsorption data fitted well to the Freundlich model (achieving as highest value for adsorption capacity K\u00a0=\u00a049.56\u00a0mg\u00a0g (mg\u00a0L), R\u00a0=\u00a00.99). Thermodynamic studies revealed that adsorption was endothermic, characterized by inner-sphere complexation, and entropy-driven with a relatively increased randomness in the solid-solution interface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that U(VI) sorption took place by surface complexation between U(VI) and oxygen containing functional groups on both biochars. Five consecutive regeneration cycles verified an excellent reusability for 1S-BC. The overall results allow to conclude that the FeCl modification of the biochar obtained from Tribulus terrestris plant biomass could give an efficient alternative adsorbent for U(VI) removal in a variety of environmental conditions, promoting protection of the environment and human health, as well as facilitating resource utilization and sustainable management of the materials studied.",

However, their effectiveness remains unclear. This review summarizes the available evidence on the beneficial impacts of several popular supplements on muscle mass or strength. Among the supplements tested, nitrate and caffeine returned sufficient evidence supporting their acute beneficial effects on muscle strength, whereas the long-term consumption of creatine, protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids seems to consistently increase or preserve muscle mass and strength (evidence level A). On the other hand, mixed or unclear evidence was found for several popular supplements including branched-chain amino acids, adenosine triphosphate, citrulline, \u03b2-Hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate, minerals, most vitamins, phosphatidic acid or arginine (evidence level B), weak or scarce evidence was found for conjugated linoleic acid, glutamine, resveratrol, tribulus terrestris or ursolic acid (evidence level C), and no evidence was found for other supplements such as ornithine or \u03b1-ketoglutarate (evidence D). Of note, although most supplements appear to be safe when consumed at typical doses, some adverse events have been reported for some of them (e.g., caffeine, vitamins, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, tribulus terrestris, arginine) after large intakes, and there is insufficient evidence to determine the safety of many frequently used supplements (e.g., ornithine, conjugated linoleic acid, ursolic acid). In summary, despite their popularity, there is little evidence supporting the use of most supplements, and some of them have been even proven ineffective or potentially associated with adverse effects.",

The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to measure the differences in serum markers and functional outcomes between the DAA and PLA for total hip arthroplasty. Forty-six patients were prospectively included and randomized for either the DAA (n\u00a0= 23) or PLA (n\u00a0= 23). All surgical procedures were performed by 3 well-trained orthopedic surgeons. The degree of tissue damage was assessed by measuring creatine kinase (CK) and C-reactive protein levels (CRP) preoperatively and 2 hours, 1 day, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks postoperatively. Generalized linear mixed models analyses were used to assess differences between serum markers over time; correction for possible confounding factors was performed. The Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and the Harris Hip Score were assessed preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively. There were no differences in patient demographics. The DAA had a longer operative time (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). CK and CRP levels increased postoperatively, but no significant differences between the groups were found on any of the time points. Functional outcomes were also similar in both approaches. No difference in tissue damage measured with serum markers CK and CRP were found between the DAA and PLA for total hip arthroplasty.",

It improves muscle performance in healthy individuals and might be helpful for treating myopathies. To evaluate the efficacy of oral creatine supplementation in muscle diseases. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register in May 2004 for randomised trials using the search term 'creatine'. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2005) using the same search term. We adapted this strategy to search MEDLINE (PubMed, from January 1966 to September 2005) and EMBASE (from January 1980 to May 2004). We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials identified, contacted the authors and known experts in the field and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data. Types of studies: randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials. people of all ages with hereditary muscle disease. Types of intervention: any creatine supplementation of at least 0.03 g/kg body weight/day. change in muscle strength measured by quantitative muscle testing. change in muscle strength measured by manual muscle testing, change in energy parameters assessed by 31 phosphorous spectroscopy, change in muscle mass or a surrogate for muscle mass, adverse events. Two authors independently applied the selection criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Some missing data were obtained from investigators. Twelve trials, including 266 participants, met the selection criteria. One trial compared creatine and glutamine treatment with placebo. In trials with 138 participants with muscular dystrophies treated with creatine, there was a significant increase in maximum voluntary contraction in the creatine group compared to placebo, with a weighted mean difference of 8.47% (95% confidence intervals 3.55 to 13.38). There was also an increase in lean body mass during creatine treatment compared to placebo (weighted mean difference 0.63 kg, 95% confidence intervals 0.02 to 1.25). No trial reported any clinically relevant adverse event. In trials with 33 participants with metabolic myopathies treated with creatine, there was no significant difference in maximum voluntary contraction between the creatine and placebo group (weighted mean difference -2.26%, confidence intervals -6.29 to 1.78). One trial reported a significant increase in muscle pain during high-dose creatine treatment (150 mg/kg body weight) in glycogen storage disease type V. Evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that short- and medium-term creatine treatment improves muscle strength in people with muscular dystrophies, and is well-tolerated. Evidence from randomised controlled trials does not show significant improvement in muscle strength in metabolic myopathies. High-dose creatine in glycogenosis type V increased muscle pain.",

However, concerns have been raised about the potential role in promoting hair loss by increasing dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Currently, there is no direct evidence examining the relationship between creatine supplementation and hair follicle health. Therefore, the purpose was to determine the effects of 12\u2009weeks of creatine supplementation on androgen levels and hair follicle health in healthy young males. Forty-five resistance-trained males (ages 18-40 years) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a creatine monohydrate (5\u2009g/day) or placebo (5\u2009g maltodextrin/day) group. Participants maintained their habitual diets and training routines. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 12\u2009weeks to measure total testosterone, free testosterone, and DHT. Hair follicle health was assessed using the Trichogram test and the FotoFinder system (hair density, follicular unit count, and cumulative hair thickness). Statistical analyses were performed using repeated measures ANOVA, and potential outliers were examined through sensitivity analysis. Thirty-eight participants completed the study, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups. There were no group-by-time interactions observed for any hormones or hair-related outcomes (\u2009>\u20090.05).

          "content": "Creatine supplementation could be a nonexpensive, safe, and effective dietary intervention to counteract bone loss. The aim of this study was to investigate whether long-term creatine supplementation can improve bone health in older, postmenopausal women. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial was conducted between November 2011 and December 2017 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Two hundred postmenopausal women with osteopenia were randomly allocated to receive either creatine monohydrate (3 g/d) or placebo for 2 years. At baseline and after 12 and 24 months, we assessed areal bone mineral density (aBMD; primary outcome), lean and fat mass (through dual X-ray absorptiometry), volumetric BMD and bone microarchitecture parameters, biochemical bone markers, physical function and strength, and the number of falls and fractures. Possible adverse effects were self-reported. Lumbar spine (p < .001), femoral neck (p < .001), and total femur aBMD (p = .032) decreased across time; however, no interaction effect was observed (all p > .050). Bone markers, microarchitecture parameters, and the number of falls/fractures were not changed with creatine (all p > .050). Lean mass and appendicular skeletal muscle mass increased throughout the intervention (p < .001), with no additive effect of creatine (p = .731 and p = .397, respectively). Creatine did not affect health-related laboratory parameters. Creatine supplementation more than 2 years did not improve bone health in older, postmenopausal women with osteopenia, nor did it affect lean mass or muscle function in this population.

          "content": "The role of creatine supplementation in young athletes and bodybuilders is well established including ergogenic properties of muscular hypertrophy, strength, power, and endurance. Whether the benefits of creatine supplementation translate to an aging population with moderate training stimulus remains unclear especially in regard to gender, creatine dose, and duration. This systematic review assessed whether creatine supplementation combined with exercise results in additive improvements in indices of skeletal muscle, bone, and mental health over exercise alone in healthy older adults. PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were utilized to identify randomized controlled trials of creatine supplementation combined with exercise in an aging population with additional predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, and performed quality assessments using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Seventeen studies were comprehensively reviewed according to categories of strength, endurance, functional capacity, body composition, cognition, and safety. These studies suggest that any additive ergogenic creatine effects on upper and/or lower body strength, functional capacity, and lean mass in an older population would require a continuous and daily low-dose creatine supplementation combined with at least 12 weeks of resistance training. Potential creatine specific increases in regional bone mineral density of the femur are possible but may require at least 1 year of creatine supplementation combined with moderate resistance training, and additional long-term clinical trials are warranted. The limited data suggested no additive effects of creatine over exercise alone on indices of mental health. The beneficial effects of creatine supplementation are more consistent in older women than in men. Creatine monohydrate is safe to use in older adults. While creatine in conjunction with moderate- to high-intensity exercise in an aging population may improve skeletal muscle health, additional studies are needed to determine the effective dosing and duration paradigm for potential combined creatine and exercise effects on bone and cognition in older adults.",

          "content": ": Creatine and \u03b2-alanine are two widely used dietary supplements known to enhance exercise performance and improve body composition; however, less is known regarding the synergistic effects of combining the two supplements. : A systematic search was conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to March 2025. Eligible studies included adult participants receiving creatine and \u03b2-alanine together compared to creatine or \u03b2-alanine alone for at least four weeks and assessed measures of exercise performance and/or body composition. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. : A total of 7 randomized controlled trials ( = 263 participants; 231 males and 32 females) met the inclusion criteria. Collectively, the combination of creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation enhanced high-intensity exercise performance, particularly anaerobic power and repeated-bout performance, compared to creatine or \u03b2-alanine alone. Co-ingestion of creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation did not increase measures of maximal strength compared to creatine alone. The effects of creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation on body composition were equivocal, with one study reporting greater lean mass gains and fat mass reductions compared to creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation individually, while another found no significant improvements. Additionally, no significant improvements in aerobic endurance capacity (VOmax, lactate threshold, or time to exhaustion) were observed from creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation co-ingestion. : The combination of creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation may be effective for enhancing high-intensity exercise performance but has no greater effect on maximal strength, body composition, or measures of aerobic capacity compared to creatine or \u03b2-alanine alone.",

          "content": "In recent years, the study of creatine supplementation in professional athletes has been of great interest. However, the genetics involved in response to supplementation is unknown. The aim of this study was to analyse, for the first time, the relationship between muscle performance-related genes and the risk of an increased body mass index (BMI) and muscle mass and a decrease in fat mass in professional football players after creatine supplementation. For this longitudinal study, one hundred and sixty-one men's professional football players were recruited. The polymorphisms  I/D,  c.1729C>T,  c.34C>T,  c.*800A>G, and  (c.49C>T and c.37885C>A) were genotyped using Single-Nucleotide Primer Extension (SNPE). To assess the combined impact of these six polymorphisms, a total genotype score (TGS) was calculated. The creatine supplementation protocol consisted of 20 g/day of creatine monohydrate for 5 days (loading dose) and 3-5 g/day for 7 weeks (maintenance dose). Anthropometric characteristics (body mass index (BMI), fat, and muscle mass) were recorded before and after the creatine supplementation protocol. Characteristics of non-contact muscle injuries during the 2022/2023 season were classified according to a consensus statement for injury recording. The results showed that the allelic frequencies of  and  differed between responders and non-responders in muscle mass increase (all  < 0.05). Players with a TGS exceeding 54.16 a.u. had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.985 (95%CI: 1.560-5.711;  = 0.001) for muscle mass increase. By contrast, those with a TGS below 54.16 a.u. had an OR of 9.385 (95%CI: 4.535-19.425;  < 0.001) for suffering non-contact muscle injuries during the season. The increase in BMI and muscle mass in response to creatine supplementation in professional football players was influenced by a TGS derived from the combination of favourable genotypes linked to muscle performance. The CC genotype and C allele of  were particularly associated with a higher likelihood of muscle mass increase under creatine supplementation in this group of professional football players.",

          "content": "This study aimed to compare the effects of an 8-week creatine (CR) or placebo (PL) supplementation on muscle strength, thickness, endurance, and body composition employing different training paradigms with blood flow restriction (BFR) vs. traditional resistance training (TRAD). Seventeen healthy males were randomized between the PL (\u00a0=\u00a09) and CR (\u00a0=\u00a08) groups. Participants were trained unilaterally utilizing a within-between subject bicep curl exercise where each arm was allocated to TRAD or BFR for 8 weeks. Muscular strength, thickness, endurance, and body composition were evaluated. Creatine supplementation promoted increases in muscle thickness in TRAD and BFR compared with their placebo counterparts, however, without a significant difference between treatments (\u00a0=\u00a00.349). TRAD training increased maximum strength (1 repetition maximum (1RM)) compared with BFR after 8 weeks of training (\u00a0=\u00a00.021). Repetitions to failure at 30% of 1RM were increased in the BFR-CR group compared with the TRAD-CR group (\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Repetitions to failure at 70% 1RM were increased from weeks 0-4 (\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 4-8 (\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in all groups. Creatine supplementation exerted a hypertrophic effect when utilized with TRAD and BFR paradigms and increased muscle performance at 30% 1RM when utilized in conjunction with BFR. Therefore, creatine supplementation seems to amplify muscle adaptation following a BFR program.

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of creatine supplementation on the body composition and Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. An exploratory 1-year balanced, placebo-controlled, and double-blind design was conducted with hemodialysis patients (\u226518 years). The creatine group (CG) received 5 g of creatine monohydrate and 5 g of maltodextrin per day and the placebo group (PG) received 10 g of maltodextrin per day. MIS and body composition were analyzed at three time points: pre, intermediate (after 6 months), and post (after 12 months). After 6 months, 60% of patients on creatine experienced an increase in FFM compared to a 36.8% increase for those on placebo. Moreover, 65% of patients on creatine increased their skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) compared to only 15.8% for those on placebo. Creatine increased intracellular water (ICW) in 60% of patients. MIS did not change after the intervention. In the CG, there was an increase in body weight ( = 0.018), FFM ( = 0.010), SMMI ( = 0.022). CG also increased total body water (pre 35.4 L, post 36.1 L;  = 0.008), mainly due to ICW (pre 20.2 L, intermediate 20.7 L, post 21.0 L;  = 0.016).

          "content": "Muscle mass is important for metastatic prostate cancer survival and quality of life (QoL). The backbone of treatment for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with an androgen signaling inhibitor. ADT is an effective cancer treatment, but it facilitates significant declines in muscle mass and adverse health outcomes important to mCSPC survivors, such as fatigue, and reductions in physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, and QoL. In non-metastatic CSPC survivors, resistance training (RT) preserves muscle mass and improves these related health outcomes, but the biggest barrier to RT in CSPC survivors of all stages is fatigue. Creatine monohydrate supplementation coupled with RT (Cr\u2009+\u2009RT) may address this barrier since creatine plays a critical role in energy metabolism. Cr\u2009+\u2009RT in cancer-free older adults and other clinical populations improves muscle mass and related health outcomes. Evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation can complement cancer treatment. Thus, Cr\u2009+\u2009RT is a strategy that addresses gaps in survivorship needs of people with mCSPC. The purpose of this parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial is to test the effects of 52-weeks of Cr\u2009+\u2009RT compared with placebo (PLA) and RT (PLA\u2009+\u2009RT) on muscle mass, other related health outcomes, and markers of cancer progression. We will carry out this trial with our team's established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program in 200 mCSPC survivors receiving ADT, and evaluate outcomes at baseline, 24-, and 52-weeks. RT will occur twice weekly with elastic resistance bands, and an established creatine supplementation protocol will be used for supplementation delivery. Our approach addresses a major facilitator to RT in mCSPC survivors, a home-based RT program, while utilizing a supervised model for safety. Findings will improve delivery of comprehensive survivorship care by providing a multicomponent, patient-centered lifestyle strategy to preserve muscle mass, improve health outcomes, and complement cancer treatment (NCT06112990).",

          "content": "A short period of leg immobilization leads to rapid loss of muscle mass and strength. Creatine supplementation has been shown to increase lean body mass in active individuals and can be used to augment gains in muscle mass and strength during prolonged resistance-type exercise training. Our objective was to investigate whether creatine loading can attenuate the loss of muscle mass and strength during short-term leg immobilization. Healthy young men (n\u00a0=\u00a030; aged 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years; body mass index [BMI] 23.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0kg/m) were randomly assigned to either a creatine or a placebo group. Subjects received placebo or creatine supplements (20\u00a0g/d) for 5\u00a0days before one leg was immobilized by means of a full-leg cast for 7\u00a0days. Muscle biopsies were taken before creatine loading, prior to and immediately after leg immobilization, and after 7\u00a0days of subsequent recovery. Quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA) (computed tomography [CT] scan) and leg muscle strength (one-repetition maximum [1-RM] knee extension) were assessed before and immediately after immobilization and after 1\u00a0week of recovery. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data are presented consistently as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error of the mean (SEM). There was a significant overall increase in muscle total creatine content following the 5-day loading phase (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049), which appeared driven by an increase in the creatine group (from 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 to 107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0mmol/kg dry muscle) with no apparent change in the placebo group (from 88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mmol/kg; p\u00a0=\u00a00.066 for time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0treatment interaction). Quadriceps muscle CSA had declined by 465\u00a0\u00b1\u00a059 and 425\u00a0\u00b1\u00a069\u00a0mm (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the creatine and placebo group, respectively, with no differences between groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.76). Leg muscle strength decreased from 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0kg in the creatine and from 59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 to 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0kg in the placebo group, with no differences between groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.20). Muscle fiber size did not change significantly over time in either group (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). When non-responders to creatine loading were excluded (n\u00a0=\u00a06), responders (n\u00a0=\u00a08; total creatine content increasing from 70 to 106\u00a0mmol/kg) showed similar findings, with no signs of preservation of muscle mass or strength during immobilization. During the subsequent recovery phase, no differences in muscle mass or strength were found between the two groups (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Creatine supplementation prior to and during leg immobilization does not prevent or attenuate the loss of muscle mass or strength during short-term muscle disuse.

          "content": "Creatine supplementation has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological therapeutic strategy to counteract muscle dysfunction and low lean mass in a variety of conditions, including in pediatric and rheumatic diseases. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of creatine supplementation in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus (C-SLE). C-SLE patients with mild disease activity (n = 15) received placebo or creatine supplementation in a randomized fashion using a crossover, double-blind, repeated-measures design. The participants were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks in each arm, interspersed by an eight-week washout period. The primary outcomes were muscle function, as assessed by a battery of tests including one-maximum repetition (1-RM) tests, the timed-up-and-go test, the timed-stands test, and the handgrip test. Secondary outcomes included body composition, biochemical markers of bone remodeling, aerobic conditioning, quality of life, and physical capacity. Possible differences in dietary intake were assessed by three 24-hour dietary recalls. Muscle phosphorylcreatine content was measured through phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31 P-MRS). The safety of the intervention was assessed by laboratory parameters, and kidney function was measured by (51)Cr-EDTA clearance. Additionally, self-reported adverse events were recorded throughout the trial. Intramuscular phosphorylcreatine content was not significantly different between creatine and placebo before or after the intervention (creatine-Pre: 20.5 \u00b1 2.6, Post: 20.4 \u00b1 4.1, placebo-Pre: 19.8 \u00b1 2.0; Post: 20.2 \u00b1 3.2 mmol/kg wet muscle; p = 0.70 for interaction between conditions). In addition, probably as a consequence of the lack of change in intramuscular phosphorylcreatine content, there were no significant changes between placebo and creatine for any muscle function and aerobic conditioning parameters, lean mass, fat mass, bone mass, and quality of life scores (p > 0.05). The (51)Cr-EDTA clearance was not altered by creatine supplementation and no side effects were noticed. A 12-week creatine supplementation protocol at 0.1 g/kg/d is well tolerated and free of adverse effects but did not affect intramuscular phosphorylcreatine, muscle function, free-fat mass or quality of life in non-active C-SLE patients.

          "content": "Much attention has been given to determining the influence of total protein intake and protein source on gains in lean body mass (LBM) and strength in response to resistance exercise training (RET). Acute studies indicate that whey protein, likely related to its higher leucine content, stimulates muscle protein synthesis to a greater extent than proteins such as soy and casein. Less clear is the extent to which the type of protein supplemented impacts strength and LBM in long-term studies (\u22656 weeks). Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effect of supplementation with soy protein to animal protein supplementation on strength and LBM in response to RET. Nine studies involving 266 participants suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis were identified. Five studies compared whey with soy protein, and four studies compared soy protein with other proteins (beef, milk, or dairy protein). Meta-analysis showed that supplementing RET with whey or soy protein resulted in significant increases in strength but found no difference between groups (bench press: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.02, p\u2009=\u2009.90; squat: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.22, p\u2009=\u2009.64). There was no significant effect of whey or soy alone (n\u2009=\u20095) on LBM change and no differences between groups (\u03c7\u2009=\u20090.00, p\u2009=\u2009.96). Strength and LBM both increased significantly in the \"other protein\" and the soy groups (n\u2009=\u20099), but there were no between-group differences (bench: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.02, p\u2009=\u2009.88; squat: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.78, p\u2009=\u2009.38; and LBM: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.06, p\u2009=\u2009.80). The results of this meta-analysis indicate that soy protein supplementation produces similar gains in strength and LBM in response to RET as whey protein.",

          "title": "The effects of whey, pea, and collagen protein supplementation beyond the recommended dietary allowance on integrated myofibrillar protein synthetic rates in older males: a randomized controlled trial.",
          "content": "Skeletal muscle mass is determined predominantly by feeding-induced and activity-induced fluctuations in muscle protein synthesis (MPS). Older individuals display a diminished MPS response to protein ingestion, referred to as age-related anabolic resistance, which contributes to the progression of age-related muscle loss known as sarcopenia. We aimed to determine the impact of consuming higher-quality compared with lower-quality protein supplements above the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) on integrated MPS rates. We hypothesized that increasing total protein intake above the RDA, regardless of the source, would support higher integrated rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis. Thirty-one healthy older males (72 \u00b1 4 y) consumed a controlled diet with protein intake set at the RDA: control phase (days 1-7). In a double-blind, randomized controlled fashion, participants were assigned to consume an additional 50 g (2 \u00d7 25g) of whey (n = 10), pea (n = 11), or collagen (n = 10) protein each day (25 g at breakfast and lunch) during the supplemental phase (days 8-15). Deuterated water ingestion and muscle biopsies assessed integrated MPS and acute anabolic signaling. Postprandial blood samples were collected to determine feeding-induced aminoacidemia. Integrated MPS was increased during supplemental with whey (1.59 \u00b1 0.11 %/d; P < 0.001) and pea (1.59 \u00b1 0.14 %/d; P < 0.001) when compared with RDA (1.46 \u00b1 0.09 %/d for the whey group; 1.46 \u00b1 0.10 %/d for the pea group); however, it remained unchanged with collagen. Supplemental protein was sufficient to overcome anabolic signaling deficits (mTORC1 and rpS6), corroborating the greater postprandial aminoacidemia. Our findings demonstrate that supplemental protein provided at breakfast and lunch over the current RDA enhanced anabolic signaling and integrated MPS in older males; however, the source of additional protein may be an important consideration in overcoming age-related anabolic resistance.

We evaluated the feasibility and effects of resistance training with and without protein supplementation on lean body mass and muscle strength among survivors. This double-blind placebo-controlled trial enrolled survivors \u226518 to <45 yr old. Participants were randomized to resistance training with protein supplement (21 g whey protein per day, 90 kcal) (RT + S) or resistance training with placebo (sucrose, 90 kcal) (RT + P). Participants received educational materials, access to a local fitness center, and a tailored resistance training program with tapered supervision. Participant retention and adherence were used to evaluate feasibility. Lean body mass and muscle strength were assessed at baseline and 24 wk, using dual x-ray absorptiometry, and dynamometer testing or one-repetition maximum testing, respectively. Mean changes were compared with two-way ANOVA. Of 70 participants randomized, 57 completed the 24-wk intervention (24 in RT + S, 33 in RT + P). The RT + S group completed 74.8% and the RT + P group completed 67.0% of exercise sessions. Mean \u00b1 SD age for those who completed was 33.1 \u00b1 7.0 yr, 67% were White and 47% female. There were no differences in change in lean mass (RT + S, 1.05 \u00b1 2.34 kg; RT + P, 0.13 \u00b1 2.19 kg; P = 0.10) or strength (grip RT + S, 1.65 \u00b1 4.17 kg; RT + P, 1.63 \u00b1 4.47 kg; P = 0.98; mean leg press RT + S, 58.4 \u00b1 78.8 kg; RT + P, 51.0 \u00b1 65.1 kg; P = 0.68) between groups.

Augmentation of protein intake with leucine may enhance the muscle protein synthetic response in older women to aid in maintaining muscle mass. We measured the acute (hourly) and integrated (daily) myofibrillar protein synthesis (myoPS) response to consumption of a high-quality mixed protein beverage compared with an isonitrogenous protein beverage with added leucine. In a parallel design, free-living, healthy older women (aged 65-75 y, n = 11/group) consumed a fixed, weight-maintaining diet with protein at 1.0 g \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1 and were randomly assigned to twice-daily consumption of either 15 g milk protein beverage containing 4.2 g leucine (LEU) or 15 g mixed protein (milk and soy) beverage containing 1.3 g leucine (CON). Unilateral leg resistance exercise allowed a determination of acute ([13C6]-phenylalanine infusion, hourly rate) and integrated (deuterated water ingestion, daily rate) exercised and rested myoPS responses. Acute myoPS increased in response to feeding in the rested (CON: 13% \u00b1 4%; LEU: 53% \u00b1 5%) and exercised (CON: 30% \u00b1 4%; LEU: 87% \u00b1 7%) leg in both groups, but the increase was greater in LEU (P < 0.001).

          "content": "In older persons, muscle loss is accelerated during physical inactivity and hypoenergetic states, both of which are features of hospitalization. Protein supplementation may represent a strategy to offset the loss of muscle during inactivity, and enhance recovery on resumption of activity. We aimed to determine if protein supplementation, with proteins of substantially different quality, would alleviate the loss of lean mass by augmenting muscle protein synthesis (MPS) while inactive during a hypoenergetic state. Participants (16 men, mean \u00b1 SD age: 69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 y; 15 women, mean \u00b1 SD age: 68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 y) consumed a diet containing 1.6 g protein \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1, with 55%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09% of protein from foods and 45%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09% from supplements, namely, whey protein (WP) or collagen peptides (CP): 30 g each, consumed 2 times/d. Participants were in energy balance (EB) for 1 wk, then began a period of energy restriction (ER; -500 kcal/d) for 1 wk, followed by ER with step reduction (ER\u00a0+\u00a0SR; <750 steps/d) for 2 wk, before a return to habitual activity in recovery (RC) for 1 wk. There were significant reductions in leg lean mass (LLM) from EB to ER, and from ER to ER\u00a0+\u00a0SR in both groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with no differences between WP and CP or when comparing the change from phase to phase. During RC, LLM increased from ER\u00a0+\u00a0SR, but in the WP group only. Rates of integrated muscle protein synthesis decreased during ER and ER\u00a0+\u00a0SR in both groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), but increased during RC only in the WP group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Protein supplementation did not confer a benefit in protecting LLM, but only supplemental WP augmented LLM and muscle protein synthesis during recovery from inactivity and a hypoenergetic state.

          "content": "Protein supplementation alone or combined with resistance training has been proposed to be effective in counteracting age-related losses of muscle mass and strength. To investigate the effect of protein supplementation alone or combined with light-intensity or heavy-load resistance exercise on muscle size, strength, and function in older adults. In a 1-y randomized controlled trial, 208 healthy older adults (>65 y) were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 interventions: 1) carbohydrate supplementation (CARB); 2) collagen protein supplementation (COLL); 3) whey protein supplementation (WHEY); 4) light-intensity resistance training 3-5 times/wk with whey protein supplementation (LITW); and 5) heavy resistance training 3 times weekly with whey protein supplementation (HRTW). Protein supplements contained 20 g protein\u00a0+\u00a010 g carbohydrate, whereas CARB contained 30 g of carbohydrates. All intervention groups received the supplement twice daily. The primary outcome was change in the quadriceps cross-sectional area (qCSA). Secondary outcomes included measures of lower extremity strength and power, functional capabilities, and body composition. There were 184 participants who completed the study. COLL and WHEY did not affect any measured parameter compared to CARB. Compared to WHEY, HRTW improved the qCSA size (between-group difference, +1.68 cm2; 95% CI, +0.41 to +2.95 cm2; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), as well as dynamic (+18.4 Nm; 95% CI, +10.1 to +26.6 Nm; P\u00a0<\u00a010-4) and isometric knee extensor strength (+23.9 Nm; 95% CI, +14.2 to +33.6 Nm; P\u00a0<\u00a010-5). LITW did not improve the qCSA size, but increased dynamic knee extensor strength compared to WHEY (+13.7 Nm; 95% CI, +5.3 and +22.1 Nm; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Recommending protein supplementation as a stand-alone intervention for healthy older individuals seems ineffective in improving muscle mass and strength. Only HRTW was effective in both preserving muscle mass and increasing strength. Thus, we recommend that future studies investigate strategies to increase long-term compliance to heavy resistance exercise in healthy older adults.

We aimed to assess the effect of whey protein supplementation alone or with vitamin D on lean mass (LM), strength, and function in older adults with or without sarcopenia or frailty. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that investigated the effect of whey protein supplementation with or without vitamin D on sarcopenia outcomes in healthy and sarcopenic or frail older adults were included. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for LM, muscle strength, and physical function data. The analysis showed that whey protein supplementation had no effect on LM and muscle strength; nevertheless, a significant improvement was found in physical function (SMD = 0.561; 95% confidence interval [CIs]: 0.256, 0.865, n = 33), particularly gait speed (GS). On the contrary, whey protein supplementation significantly improved LM (SMD = 0.982; 95% CI: 0.228, 1.736; n = 11), appendicular lean mass and physical function (SMD = 1.211; 95% CI: 0.588, 1.834; n = 16), and GS in sarcopenic/frail older adults. By contrast, co-supplementation with vitamin D enhanced LM gains (SMD =0.993; 95% CI: 0.112, 1.874; n = 11), muscle strength (SMD =2.005; 95% CI: 0.975, 3.035; n = 11), and physical function (SMD = 3.038; 95% CI: 2.196, 3.879; n = 18) significantly. Muscle strength and physical function improvements after whey protein supplementation plus vitamin D were observed without resistance exercise (RE) and short study duration subgroups. Moreover, the combination of whey protein and vitamin D with RE did not enhance the effect of RE. Whey protein supplementation improved LM and function in sarcopenic/frail older adults but had no positive effect in healthy older persons. By contrast, our meta-analysis showed that co-supplementation with whey protein and vitamin D is effective, particularly in healthy older adults, which is likely owing, we propose, to the correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.

To determine the impact of protein supplementation during chronic endurance training on aerobic capacity, body composition and exercise performance in healthy and clinical populations. A systematic database search was conducted for randomised controlled trials addressing the effects of protein supplementation during endurance training on aerobic capacity, body composition and exercise performance in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Meta-analyses were performed to outline the overall effects of protein supplementation with all studies containing endurance training components. The effects of endurance training and add-on effects of protein supplementation were evaluated by the meta-analyses with endurance training-focused studies. Nineteen studies and 1162 participants contributed to the analyses. Compared with the control group, the protein supplementation group demonstrated greater improvements in aerobic capacity measured by mixed peak oxygen uptake (V\u0307O) and peak workload power (W) (standardised mean difference [SMD]\u00a0=\u00a00.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05 to 0.67), and V\u0307O (mean difference [MD]\u00a0=\u00a00.89\u00a0mL\u2027kg\u2027min, 95% CI: 0.07 to 1.70); had a greater lean mass gain (MD\u00a0=\u00a00.32\u00a0kg, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.58); and had a greater improvement in time trial performance (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-29.1s, 95% CI:-55.3 to\u00a0-3.0).

A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and EBSCOhost/SPORTDiscus was conducted. Eligibility criteria: Randomized controlled trials comparing all types of milk-based protein supplements with control supplements for the training older adults at mean age \u2265 60 y. Twenty studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, whilst seventeen studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. A dose of 10-15 g of milk protein supplementation was sufficient to augment RT-induced LBM/FFM. Intriguingly, four out of five studies show negative effect of whey protein supplementation at the same dose range (or even higher) compared with control supplementation (-0.49 kg, 95% CI: -0.69, -0.29, I = 14%, Z = 4.82,  < 0.001). For milk-based protein supplementation, RT-induced improvements in muscle strength were observed only when the protein doses \u226522 g (+0.66 kg, 95% CI: 0.07, 1.25, I = 0%, Z = 2.18,  = 0.03). Conclusion: Milk protein is superior to whey protein in enhancing RT-induced LBM/FFM gains for older adults. Optimal daily protein intake can dilute the protein supplementation effect.",

          "content": "It has been proposed that protein supplementation during resistance exercise training enhances muscle hypertrophy. The degree of hypertrophy during training is controlled in part through the activation of satellite cells and myonuclear accretion. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of protein supplementation (and the type of protein) during traditional resistance training on myofiber cross-sectional area, satellite cell content, and myonuclear addition. Healthy young men participated in supervised whole-body progressive resistance training 3 d\u00b7wk for 12 wk. Participants were randomized to one of three groups ingesting a daily 22-g macronutrient dose of soy-dairy protein blend (PB, n = 22), whey protein isolate (WP, n = 15), or an isocaloric maltodextrin placebo (MDP, n = 17). Lean mass, vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional area, satellite cell content, and myonuclear addition were assessed before and after resistance training. PB and the pooled protein treatments (PB + WP = PRO) exhibited a greater whole-body lean mass %change compared with MDP (P = 0.057 for PB) and (P = 0.050 for PRO), respectively. All treatments demonstrated similar leg muscle hypertrophy and vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional area (P < 0.05). Increases in myosin heavy chain I and II myofiber satellite cell content and myonuclei content were also detected after exercise training (P < 0.05). Protein supplementation during resistance training has a modest effect on whole-body lean mass as compared with exercise training without protein supplementation, and there was no effect on any outcome between protein supplement types (blend vs whey). However, protein supplementation did not enhance resistance exercise-induced increases in myofiber hypertrophy, satellite cell content, or myonuclear addition in young healthy men. We propose that as long as protein intake is adequate during muscle overload, the adaptations in muscle growth and function will not be influenced by protein supplementation.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia is a prevalent condition in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Therefore, a convenient and reliable method of monitoring muscle health is required. This study identified the utility of the phase angle (PhA) to estimate muscle health, and evaluated its changes following intradialytic neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and oral nutritional supplement interventions in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. This post-hoc analysis was conducted using data obtained from a 12-week multicenter randomized trial that examined the effects of NMES and protein supplementation. The participants were divided into four groups according to intradialytic NMES and protein supplementation. The PhA, muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance were measured every 4 weeks. Overall, 59 participants completed the study. PhA values were linearly associated with muscle mass and muscle strength. Additionally, high PhA levels indicated fast gait speed and shortened timed up-and-go test (TUG) results. We further evaluated the association between the PhA slope and muscle health-related parameters. In participants with the PhA slope &lt;0\u00b0 over 12 weeks, TUG results worsened over time, relative to those with a slope \u22650\u00b0 over 12 weeks, independent of age, sex, diabetes, and body mass index. NMES did not improve the PhA values over time; however, protein supplementation tended to increase the PhA values. PhA is a reliable marker for estimating and monitoring muscle health in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, and a strong association exists between PhA and TUG results.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the caffeine intake (from coffee) and fat-free mass index (FFMI). We carried out a cohort study that included 3,466 women and 3,145 men aged \u226520\u2009years who were intaking caffeine. Caffeine intake from coffee were obtained from two 24-hour dietary recall interviews. The FFMI was calculated as FFM (kg) divided by height in m. The caffeine intake was classified into quartiles and combined into 4 groups. Multiple linear regression model analysis and multiple logistic regression model analysis were used to assess associations between the caffeine and FFMI adjusted for potential confounders. Among the 2,427 participants, males accounted for 52.4%, and females 47.6%. In multiple linear regression model, Model 1 (unadjusted Model (\u2009=\u20090.041)) and Model 2 (adjusted for age, race, and BMI (\u2009=\u20090.006)) in women showed a significant relationship between caffeine intake and FFMI. In multivariable models, caffeine intake and FFMI were significantly different (\u2009<\u20090.05). In sex subgroups, among females, each quartile of caffeine intake was positively correlated with FFMI levels in the average FFMI group in Model 3 (\u2009<\u20090.001). In age subgroups, each quartile of caffeine intake was positively correlated with FFMI levels in the average FFMI group in Model 3 for individuals aged 20-40 (\u2009=\u20090.039) and those aged above 40 (\u2009=\u20090.016). In drinking status subgroups, if they drunk alcohol, each quartile was positively correlated with FFMI levels in the average FFMI group in Model 3 (\u2009<\u20090.001). Caffeine intake was mainly positively associated with FFMI, especially in women with above levels of FFMI. Longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to establish causality and provide evidence-based recommendations regarding caffeine intake to optimize muscle health.",

The article \"Association Between Caffeine Intake and Fat-Free Mass Index: A Retrospective Cohort Study\" by Tian et al. explored this relationship, highlighting a positive correlation between caffeine consumption and fat-free mass index (FFMI). In this letter to the editor, we discuss the broader implications of these findings, emphasizing the need for further exploration of the underlying biological and lifestyle factors influencing caffeine's effects. To provide critical insights into the mechanisms and contextual factors that may explain the observed association between caffeine intake and FFMI, with particular focus on sex-specific differences, hormonal influences, and lifestyle interactions. This letter to editor builds on the findings of Tian et al., drawing from related literature and prior research to contextualize the potential mechanisms and broader implications of caffeine's impact on body composition. The discussion highlights key areas requiring further investigation, including the role of hormonal modulation, genetic variability, and long-term effects on muscle health. The positive association between caffeine intake and FFMI, particularly among women and younger populations, underscores the ergogenic potential of caffeine in enhancing muscle performance and metabolic efficiency. This letter expands on the study by emphasizing the role of hormonal factors, such as estrogen's modulation of CYP1A2, the liver enzyme critical for caffeine metabolism. The discussion also highlights the complex interplay between caffeine and other lifestyle factors. Finally, this commentary calls attention to the need for more research into the differential effects of caffeine sources, such as energy drinks and supplements, which often include additional ingredients with distinct metabolic and cardiovascular effects. These alternative sources may influence body composition differently than traditional coffee-based caffeine intake, an area that remains underexplored.",

          "content": "\u03b2-alanine does not have an ergogenic effect by itself, but it does as a precursor for the synthesis of carnosine in human skeletal muscle. \u03b2-alanine and carnosine together help improve the muscles' functionality, especially in high-intensity exercises such as combat sports. Therefore, \u03b2-alanine could be considered a nutritional ergogenic aid to improve sports performance in combat athletes. We aimed to critically review clinical trial evidence on the impact of \u03b2-alanine supplementation on sports performance, perception, and anthropometric parameters, as well as circulating biochemical markers in combat athletes. This systematic review was conducted following the specific methodological guidelines of the Preferred Report Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA), the PICOS question model, the Critical Review Form of McMaster, and the PEDro scale. Furthermore, the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool was used. The search was carried out in the SCOPUS, Web of Science (WOS), and Medline (PubMed) databases for studies published from the beginning of the database until July 31, 2023. Of the 41 registers identified, only 7 met the established criteria and were included in this systematic review. Overall, performance parameters related to strength, power, total exercise work capacity, and combat-specific parameters were significantly improved ( < 0.05). Perception parameters increased non-significantly ( > 0.05). Regarding biochemical parameters, carnosine increased significantly ( < 0.05), pH decreased non-significantly ( > 0.05), and the results for blood bicarbonate and blood lactate were heterogeneous. Finally, there was a non-significant ( > 0.05) improvement in the anthropometric parameters of lean mass and fat mass. \u03b2-alanine supplementation appears to be safe and could be a suitable nutritional ergogenic aid for combat athletes.",

          "content": "Moderate altitudes carry physiological and metabolic changes that can dampen exercise performance. Fortunately, these changes can be modulated by an optimal nutritional intervention. This case study represents the first nutritional intervention of a moderate altitude athlete. These results may help to establish well-designed nutritional guidelines for moderate altitude sports athletes. This case study examined the effects of a 11-week nutritional intervention on body composition, muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, resting and exercise nutrient oxidation, and subjective sleep quality, in a male high-level moderate altitude athlete with a very light non-exercise activity thermogenesis. During the 11-week of nutritional intervention, 2800-3500 kcal/day, 6.8-8.9\u00a0g/kg/day of carbohydrates, 1.2-1.7\u00a0g/kg/day of protein, and 1-2.5\u00a0g/kg/day of fat were prescribed. Different specific considerations were also included, such as: iron supplementation, antioxidants increment in different phases, and ergogenic aids (i.e. creatine and beta-alanine). Our results demonstrated a decrease in adiposity and an increase in fat-free mass. In parallel, the athlete improved muscle strength, and therefore endurance adaptations after a maximal effort test (i.e. enhancement of the heart rate recovery). After the intervention, the athlete not only increased the carbohydrate oxidation during exercise and resting conditions but also improved his subjective sleep quality. Our results suggest that a nutritional intervention based on the endurance nutritional recommendations and adapted to the altitude physiological peculiarities can induce body re-composition, improve physiological adaptations to effort, and upgrade the substrate oxidation in a moderate altitude high-level athletes.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia, a reduction in muscle mass and function seen in aging populations, may be countered by improving systemic carnosine stores via beta-Alanine (\u03b2-alanine) supplementation. Increasing systemic carnosine levels may result in enhanced anti-oxidant, neuro-protective and pH buffering capabilities. This enhancement should result in improved exercise capacity and executive function. Twelve healthy adults (average age\u2009=\u200960.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6\u00a0yrs, weight\u2009=\u200981.5\u2009\u00b1\u200912.6\u00a0kg) were randomized and given either 2.4\u00a0g/d of \u03b2-alanine (BA) or Placebo (PL) for 28\u00a0days. Exercise capacity was tested via bouts on a cycle ergometer at 70% VO peak. Executive function was measured by Stroop Tests 5\u00a0min before exercise (T1), immediately before exercise (T2), immediately following fatigue (T3), and 5\u00a0min after fatigue (T4). Lactate measures were taken pre/post exercise. Heart rate, Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and VO were recorded throughout exercise testing. PRE average time-to-exhaustion (TTE) for the PL and BA group were not significantly different (Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD; 9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4mins vs 11.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4mins, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.7). POST BA supplemented subjects cycled significantly longer than PRE (14.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8mins vs 11.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4mins, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.04) while those given PL did not (8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4mins vs 9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4mins, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.7). PL subjects were slower in completing the Stroop test POST at T4 compared to T3 (T3\u2009=\u2009-\u200913.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6% vs T4\u2009=\u20092.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3%, P\u2009=\u20090.04), while the BA group (T3\u2009=\u2009-\u20099.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4% vs T4\u2009=\u2009-\u20092.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.5) was not. POST lactate production expressed a trend when comparing treatments, as the BA group produced 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6\u00a0mmol/L more lactate than the PL group (P\u2009=\u20090.06). Within group lactate production for BA (P\u2009=\u20090.4) and PL (P\u2009=\u20090.5), RPE (P\u2009=\u20090.9) and heart rate (P\u2009=\u20090.7) did not differ with supplementation. BA supplementation increased exercise capacity and eliminated endurance exercise induced declines in executive function seen after recovery. Increased POST TTE coupled with similar PRE vs POST lactate production indicates an improvement in the ability of BA to extend exercise durations. Furthermore, by countering endurance exercise's accompanying deficits in executive function, the aging population can maintain benefits from exercise with improved safety.",

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of supplementation with T+ (SUP; Onnit Labs, Austin, TX, USA), an MIPS containing long jack root, beta-alanine, and branched-chain amino acids, and other proprietary blends, on strength, body composition, and hormones in young resistance-trained men. Subjects were randomized to consume either T+ (SUP; n = 14; age, 21 \u00b1 3 years; body fat, 18.3 \u00b1 4.7%) or an isocaloric placebo (PL; n = 13; age, 21 \u00b1 3 years; body fat, 21.5 \u00b1 6.2%) for 4 weeks. Both groups underwent a progressive, 4-week high-intensity resistance training protocol. Before and after the training protocol, mood state, body composition, blood hormones (also collected at midpoint), and maximal strength were measured. SUP had significantly greater increases in bench press (SUP, 102 \u00b1 16 kg to 108 \u00b1 16 kg vs. PL, 96 \u00b1 22 kg to 101 \u00b1 22 kg; p < 0.001) and total weight lifted (SUP, 379 \u00b1 59 kg to 413 \u00b1 60 kg vs. PL, 376 \u00b1 70 kg to 400 \u00b1 75 kg; p < 0.001) compared with PL. Additionally, deadlift strength relative to total body mass (calculated as weight lifted/body mass; kg:kg) (2.08 \u00b1 0.18 to 2.23 \u00b1 0.16; p = 0.036) and lean mass (2.55 \u00b1 0.19 to 2.72 \u00b1 0.16; p = 0.021) increased significantly in SUP but not PL (2.02 \u00b1 0.30 to 2.15 \u00b1 0.36 and 2.56 \u00b1 0.31 to 2.70 \u00b1 0.36, respectively). No other significant differences were detected between groups for the remaining variables. Supplementing with SUP enhanced resistance training adaptations independent of hormonal status, and thus SUP use may warrant inclusion into peri-workout nutrition regimens.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of beta-alanine supplementation on body composition indices. Online databases, including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, were searched up to April 2021 to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which examined the effect of beta-alanine supplementation on body composition indices. Meta-analyses were carried out using a random-effects model. The I index was used to assess the heterogeneity of RCTs. Among the initial 1413 studies that were identified from electronic databases search, 20 studies involving 492 participants were eligible. Pooled effect size from 20 studies indicated that beta-alanine supplementation has no effect on body mass (WMD: -0.15 kg; 95% CI: -0.78 to 0.47;  =\u00a00.631, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.998), fat mass (FM) (WMD: -0.24 kg; 95% CI: -1.16 to 0.68;  =\u00a00.612, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.969), body fat percentage (BFP) (WMD: -0.06%; 95% CI: -0.53 to 0.40;  =\u00a00.782, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.936), and fat-free mass (FFM) (WMD: 0.05 kg; 95% CI: -0.71 to 0.82;  =\u00a00.889, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.912). Subgroup analyses based on exercise type (resistance training [RT], endurance training [ET], and combined training [CT]), study duration (<8 and \u22658\u00a0weeks), and beta-alanine dosage (<6 and \u22656\u00a0g/d) demonstrated similar results. Certainty of evidence across outcomes ranged from low to moderate. This meta-analysis study suggests that beta-alanine supplementation is unlikely to improve body composition indices regardless of supplementation dosage and its combination with exercise training. No studies have examined the effect of beta-alanine combined with both diet and exercise on body composition changes as the primary variable. Therefore, future studies examining the effect of the combination of beta-alanine supplementation with a hypocaloric diet and exercise programs are warranted.",

          "content": "Physical activity and nutrition play important roles in preventing adverse health outcomes that accompany aging. It has been shown that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) combined with citrulline (CIT) supplementation can improve physical and functional capacities. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum metabolites following a 12-week HIIT combined or not with CIT in obese older adults, and to correlate the metabolic changes with clinico-biological parameters changes. Eighty-six obese older adults completed a 12-week HIIT program combined with a 10\u2005g daily supplementation of either CIT or placebo (PLA) during a double-blinded randomized interventional trial. Only participants with blood samples at T0 (before the intervention) and/or T12 (after the intervention) were included in our sub-analysis (HIIT-PLA-T0: n\u2009=\u200944 and HIIT-PLA-T12: n\u2009=\u200928; HIIT-CIT-T0: n\u2009=\u200939 and HIIT-CIT-T12: n\u2009=\u200942). Serum samples were analyzed by different liquid or gas phase chromatography methods coupled to mass spectrometry. Among the identified metabolites, 44 changed significantly following the 12-week intervention (Time effect), and 10 of them were more affected when HIIT was combined with CIT (Time\u2009Supp effect). Arginine increased significantly due to the 12-week intervention. Correlation analyses demonstrated that decreased triglyceride (TG) (16:1/18:1/16:0) and aspartic acid significantly correlated with a reduction of adiposity-related parameters (fat mass, leg lean mass, leptin, total triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein). Arginine, TG (16:1/18:1/16:0) and aspartic acid might constitute biomarkers of cardiometabolic health and adiposity. Further studies are needed to confirm these associations and understand the underlying mechanisms. A 12-week intervention involving high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with or without citrulline (CIT) supplementation induced adaptations in the serum metabolome of obese older adults through significant changes in 44 metabolites.Changes in 23 metabolites were observed when a CIT supplementation was administered along with a 12-week HIIT intervention.TG (16:1/18:1/16:0) correlated with several adiposity parameters including leptin, triglycerides, legs lean mass.Aspartic acid correlated with several adiposity parameters including leptin, LDL cholesterol as well as android, arms and trunk fat mass.",

          "content": "To Establish the potential of Citrulline supplementation (CIT) combined or not with exercise on muscle function and physical performance via a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in human aged 50 years and older. Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guideline, 103 references have been identified. Among this number, only six RCTs (250 participants) matched the inclusion criteria and were included in the present systematic review. Among the included studies, five of six reported beneficial effects of CIT on muscle mass. Then, four of six studies reported CIT effects on muscle strength but also that CIT when combined to exercise results in further improvements in upper muscle strength. Finally, three of six studies reported beneficial CIT effect on physical performance and suggested that CIT with exercise displayed greater improvements in walking speed than exercise alone. CIT supplementation seems to be able to improve muscular and physical factors in frail elderly people (malnourished, hypertensive, obese, dynapenic-obese) compared to placebo. More importantly, CIT combined to exercise is more efficient than exercise or CIT alone. However, because of the small number (six) and heterogeneity (dose, duration, population) of the studies realized in older adults, further studies are needed to confirm its promising potential.",

          "content": "Hypertension is highly prevalent in postmenopausal women. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with hypertension and the age-related decreases in muscle mass and strength. L-citrulline supplementation (CIT) and slow velocity low-intensity resistance training (SVLIRT) have improved vascular function, but their effect on muscle mass is unclear. We investigated whether combined CIT and SVLIRT (CIT + SVLIRT) would have additional benefits on leg endothelial function (superficial femoral artery flow-mediated dilation (sfemFMD)), lean mass (LM), and strength in hypertensive postmenopausal women. Participants were randomized to CIT (10 g/day, n = 13) or placebo (PL, n = 11) alone for 4 weeks and CIT + SVLIRT or PL + SVLIRT for another 4 weeks. sfemFMD, leg LM and muscle strength were measured at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. CIT increased sfemFMD after 4 weeks (CIT: \u03941.8 \u00b1 0.3% vs. PL: \u0394\u22120.2 \u00b1 0.5%, p < 0.05) and 8 weeks (CIT + SVLIRT: \u03942.7 \u00b1 0.5% vs. PL + SVLIRT: \u0394\u22120.02 \u00b1 0.5, p = 0.003). Leg LM improved after CIT + SVLIRT compared to PL + SVLIRT (\u03940.49 \u00b1 0.15 kg vs. \u03940.07 \u00b1 0.12 kg, p < 0.05). Leg curl strength increased greater with CIT + SVLIRT compared to PL + SVLIRT (\u03946.9 \u00b1 0.9 kg vs. \u03944.0 \u00b1 1.0 kg, p < 0.05). CIT supplementation alone improved leg endothelial function and when combined with SVLIRT has additive benefits on leg LM and curl strength in hypertensive postmenopausal women.",

          "content": "Supplementation of combined glutathione (GSH) with L-citrulline in response to a single bout of resistance exercise has been shown to increase plasma nitric oxide metabolites, nitrite and nitrate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which may play a role in muscle protein synthesis. As a result, in response to resistance training (RT) these responses may establish a role for GSH\u2009+\u2009L-citrulline to increase muscle mass. This study attempted to determine the effects of an 8-week RT program in conjunction with GSH (Setria\u00ae)\u2009+\u2009L-citrulline, L-citrulline-malate, or placebo supplementation on lean mass and its association with muscle strength. The secondary purpose was to assess the safety of such supplementation protocol by assessing clinical chemistry markers. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 75 resistance-trained males were randomly assigned to ingest GSH\u2009+\u2009L-citrulline (GSH\u2009+\u2009CIT), L-citrulline-malate, or cellulose placebo daily while also participating in 8\u00a0weeks of RT. The full dose of each supplement was delivered in capsules that were identical in weight, size, shape, and color. Participants completed testing sessions for body composition and muscle strength before and after 4 and 8\u00a0weeks of RT and supplementation. Venous blood samples were obtained before and after 8\u00a0weeks. Leg press was increased with RT but was not significantly different between groups (p\u2009>\u20090.05); however, bench press strength was not increased with RT (p\u2009>\u20090.05). There were no significant changes in total body mass, fat mass, or total body water during 8\u00a0weeks of RT and supplementation. Lean mass increased in both GSH\u2009+\u2009CIT when compared to PLC; however, the increase was significant only after 4\u00a0weeks. Lean mass and strength were positively correlated (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in GSH\u2009+\u2009CIT, but not CIT-malate or PLC. Neither RT nor supplementation had any significant effects on blood clinical chemistry variables (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Compared to PLC, supplementation of GSH\u2009+\u2009CIT during resistance training increased lean mass after 4\u00a0weeks of RT and was positively associated with muscle strength. However, after 8\u00a0weeks of RT there were no significant differences in any of the measured variables.",

          "content": "Citrulline (CIT), is not extracted by the splanchnic area, can stimulate muscle protein synthesis and could potentially find clinical applications in conditions involving low amino acid (AA) intake, such as in malnourished older subjects. Our purpose was to research the effects of CIT supplementation on protein metabolism in particular on non-oxidative leucine disposal (NOLD, primary endpoint), and splanchnic extraction of amino acids in malnourished older patients. This prospective randomized multicenter study determined whole-body and liver protein synthesis, splanchnic protein metabolism and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM) in 24 malnourished older patients [80-92 years; 18 women and 6 men] in inpatient rehabilitation units. All received an oral dose of 10\u00a0g of CIT or an equimolar mixture of six non-essential amino acids (NEAAs), as isonitrogenous placebo, for 3 weeks. NOLD and albumin fractional synthesis rates were not different between the NEAA and CIT groups. Splanchnic extraction of dietary amino acid tended to decrease (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09) in the CIT group (45.2%) compared with the NEAA group (60.3%). Total differences in AA and NEAA area under the curves between fed-state and postabsorptive-state were significantly higher in the CIT than in the NEAA group. There were no significant differences for body mass index, fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM) or ASMM in the whole population except for a tendential decrease in FM for the citrulline group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.089). Compared with Day 1, lean mass and ASMM significantly increased (respectively p\u00a0=\u00a00.016 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) at Day 20 in CIT-treated women (mean respective increase of 1.7\u00a0kg and 1.1\u00a0kg), and fat mass significantly decreased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) at Day 20 in CIT-group women (mean decrease of 1.3\u00a0kg). Our results demonstrate that CIT supplementation has no effect on whole-body protein synthesis or liver protein synthesis in malnourished older subjects. However, CIT supplementation was associated with a higher systemic AA availability. In the subgroup of women, CIT supplementation increased LM and ASMM, and decreased FM.",

J Strength Cond Res 36(12): 3562-3570, 2022-This systematic review examines the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation (SUP) on muscle strength and hypertrophy when combined with physical exercise. The databases PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE were searched for full-text articles published between January 2000 and June 2020. For inclusion, studies had to report on the effects of SUP administered as acute or chronic doses together with a standardized exercise protocol on muscle strength and hypertrophy compared with placebo in healthy adults who were sedentary, physically active, or professional athletes. Twelve studies (1,571 subjects) were finally selected. In 5 studies, the SUP regime was acute, and in 7, it was chronic. SUP was nitrate-rich beetroot juice in 9 studies, a potassium nitrate capsule in 1, and increased dietary nitrate in 2. Ingested nitrate was 64-1,200 mg. Of the 12 studies, 6 observed an ergogenic effect of SUP compared with placebo. These findings indicate that muscle strength gains are possible provided the dose, format, frequency, period, and exercise test are appropriate. Best results were observed with a minimum acute dose of 400 mg of nitrate provided as beetroot juice/shot taken 2-2.5 hours before exercise involving low- and high-intensity muscle contractions. This SUP regime seems to improve muscle efficiency in terms of reduced phosphocreatine and energy costs (P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and improved time to exhaustion.",

Blood flow and MAP were measured using Doppler ultrasound and an automated monitor, respectively. Dietary nitrate increased plasma-[nitrite] Off-Meds and On-Meds. There were no significant effects of dietary nitrate on blood flow, MAP, or vascular conductance during HG in Off-Meds or On-Meds. For KE, dietary nitrate decreased MAP (means \u00b1 SD across all 3 exercise intensities, 118\u2009\u00b1\u200914 vs. 122\u2009\u00b1\u200914 mmHg,  = 0.024) and increased vascular conductance (26.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 vs. 24.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.0 mL/min/mmHg,  = 0.024), but did not affect blood flow for Off-Meds, with no effects On-Meds. Dietary nitrate-induced changes in blood flow ( = -0.67,  < 0.001), MAP ( = -0.43,  = 0.009), and vascular conductance ( = -0.64,  < 0.001) during KE, but only vascular conductance ( = -0.35,  = 0.039) during HG, were significantly related to the magnitude of placebo values, with no differentiation between groups. Thus, the effects of dietary nitrate on limb hemodynamics and MAP during exercise in patients with hypertension are dependent on the values at baseline, independent of antihypertensive medication status, and dependent on whether exercise was performed by the forearm or quadriceps. Adverse hemodynamic responses to exercise in patients with hypertension, despite antihypertensive medication, indicate a sustained cardiovascular risk. The efficacy of dietary nitrate to improve limb vascular conductance during exercise was inversely dependent on the magnitude of exercising limb vascular conductance at baseline, rather than antihypertensive medication status. The effects of dietary nitrate on hemodynamics during exercise in patients with hypertension are dependent on the values at baseline and independent of antihypertensive medication status.",

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of 5-day supplementation of NO3\u2212 on BP responses during a short isometric contraction and a sustained ischaemic contraction. In a randomised, double-blinded, crossover design, 14 healthy active young adults underwent BP measurements after 5 days of either NO3\u2212 (NIT) or placebo (PLA) supplementation. Beat-by-beat BP was measured at pre- and post-exercise rest, and during a short (20 s) isometric contraction at 25% maximal strength and throughout a sustained ischaemic contraction. Plasma nitrite (NO2\u2212) concentration increased significantly after NO3\u2212 supplementation compared to placebo (475 \u00b1 93 nmol\u00b7L\u22121 vs. 198 \u00b1 46 nmol\u00b7L\u22121, p < 0.001, d = 3.37). Systolic BP was significantly lower at pre- (p = 0.051) and post-exercise rest (p = 0.006), during a short isometric contraction (p = 0.030), and throughout a sustained ischaemic contraction (p = 0.040) after NO3\u2212 supplementation. Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower at pre- (p = 0.004) and post-exercise rest (p = 0.043), during a short isometric contraction (p = 0.041), and throughout a sustained ischaemic contraction (p = 0.021) after NO3\u2212 supplementation. Diastolic BP was lower at pre-exercise rest (p = 0.032), but not at post-exercise rest, during a short isometric contraction, and during a sustained ischaemic contraction (all p > 0.05). Five days of NO3\u2212 supplementation elevated plasma NO2\u2212 concentration and reduced BP during a short isometric contraction and a sustained ischaemic contraction in healthy adults. These observations indicate that multiple-day nitrate supplementation can decrease BP at rest and attenuate the increased BP response during isometric exercise. These findings support that NO3\u2212 supplementation is an effective nutritional intervention in reducing SBP and MAP in healthy young males during submaximal exercise.",

          "content": "Most patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) have decreased skeletal muscle mass, malnutrition, and decreased physical activity levels. These comorbidities may prevent early recovery after surgery. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of oral nutritional formula-enriched \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methyl-butyrate (HMB), a leucine metabolite that promotes muscle synthesis and suppresses proteolysis, on postoperative sarcopenia and other outcomes after adult-to-adult living donor LT (LDLT). Thirty-three consecutive patients who underwent adult LDLT between March 2017 and October 2018 and who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the HMB or control group. Patients in the HMB group received two packs of HMB-rich nutrients per day, which contained calcium-HMB (1500 mg), l-arginine (7000 mg), and l -glutamine (7000 mg) per pack orally or enterally from postoperative day 1 to 30 with postoperative rehabilitation. The primary endpoint was grip strength (GS) at 2 mo after LDLT. Secondary endpoints included GS at 1 mo after LDLT, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) at 1 and 2 mo after LDLT, laboratory findings, incidence of postoperative bacteremia, and postoperative hospital length of stay (LOS). Twelve patients in the HMB group and 11 in the control group were included in the final analysis. GS at 1 and 2 mo and SMI values at 2 mo were significantly higher in the HMB group than in the control group (GS: both P < 0.001, SMI: P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). In the HMB group, white blood cell count 3 wk after LDLT was significantly lower (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and postoperative hospital LOS was significantly shorter (P\u00a0=\u00a00.028) compared with the control group. The incidence of postoperative bacteremia was lower in the HMB group. Postoperative administration of HMB-enriched formula with rehabilitation significantly increased GS at 1 and 2 mo and SMI at 2 mo and shortened postoperative hospital LOS after LDLT.",

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 44 resistance-trained men (age: 26 \u00b1 4 years; body mass: 84.9 \u00b1 12.0\u00a0kg) consuming \u22651.7\u00a0g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7day-1 of protein received HMB-FA (3\u00a0g/day; n = 14), HMB-Ca (3\u00a0g/day; n = 15), or placebo (PL; cornstarch, 3\u00a0g/day; n = 15) for 12 weeks, while performing a periodized resistance training program. Before and after intervention, lean body mass (measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry), maximal dynamic strength (one-repetition maximum), knee extension maximal isometric strength (maximal voluntary isometric contraction [MVIC]), cross-sectional area (measured with ultrasound), and muscle soreness were assessed. MVIC was also measured 48\u00a0hr after the first and the last training sessions. All groups increased lean body mass (main time effect: p < .0001; HMB-FA: 1.8 \u00b1 1.8\u00a0kg; HMB-Ca: 0.8 \u00b1 1.4\u00a0kg; PL: 0.9 \u00b1 1.4\u00a0kg), cross-sectional area (main time effect: p < .0001; HMB-FA: 6.6 \u00b1 3.8%; HMB-Ca: 4.7 \u00b1 4.4%; PL: 6.9 \u00b1 3.8%), one-repetition maximum bench press (main time effect: p < .0001; HMB-FA: 14.8 \u00b1 8.4\u00a0kg; HMB-Ca: 11.8 \u00b1 7.4\u00a0kg; PL: 11.2 \u00b1 6.6\u00a0kg), MVIC (main time effect: p < .0001; HMB-FA: 34.4 \u00b1 39.3%; HMB-Ca: 32.3 \u00b1 27.4%; PL: 17.7 \u00b1 20.9%) after the intervention, but no differences between groups were shown.

No long-term studies utilizing HMB free acid (HMB-FA) have been conducted. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 12 weeks of HMB-FA supplementation on skeletal muscle hypertrophy, body composition, strength, and power in trained individuals. We also determined the effects of HMB-FA on muscle damage and performance during an overreaching cycle. A three-phase double-blind, placebo- and diet-controlled randomized intervention study was conducted. Phase 1 was an 8-week-periodized resistance-training program; Phase 2 was a 2-week overreaching cycle; and Phase 3 was a 2-week taper. Muscle mass, strength, and power were examined at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 to assess the chronic effects of HMB-FA; and assessment of these, as well as cortisol, testosterone, and creatine kinase (CK) was performed at weeks 9 and 10 of the overreaching cycle. HMB-FA resulted in increased total strength (bench press, squat, and deadlift combined) over the 12-week training (77.1 \u00b1 18.4 vs. 25.3 \u00b1 22.0 kg, p < 0.001); a greater increase in vertical jump power (991 \u00b1 168 vs. 630 \u00b1 167 W, p < 0.001); and increased lean body mass gain (7.4 \u00b1 4.2 vs. 2.1 \u00b1 6.1 kg, p < 0.001) in HMB-FA- and placebo-supplemented groups, respectively. During the overreaching cycle, HMB-FA attenuated increases in CK (-6 \u00b1 91 vs. 277 \u00b1 229 IU/l, p < 0.001) and cortisol (-0.2 \u00b1 2.9 vs. 4.5 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcg/dl, p < 0.003) in the HMB-FA- and placebo-supplemented groups, respectively. These results suggest that HMB-FA enhances hypertrophy, strength, and power following chronic resistance training, and prevents decrements in performance following the overreaching.",

          "content": "Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, is currently widely used in athletes to increase muscle mass and strength and has also been used as a nutritional supplement in recent years to maintain muscle mass in muscular atrophic diseases of older people. However, the effects of HMB supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function in older people remain controversial. The purpose of this review was to explore the effects of HMB on body composition in older adults. The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to obtain the randomized controlled trials needed as a basis for systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of 9 studies (448 participants) were eventually found eligible. The pooled results showed that HMB supplementation significantly increased fat-free mass in older people compared with the control group (effect size: 0.37; 95% Cl 0.16, 0.58; Z value\u2009=\u20093.47, P\u2009=\u20090.001; Fixed-effect model).

Subgroup analysis of HMB supplementation alone showed a significant improvement in fat-free mass in older people (effect size: 0.59; 95% CI 0.32, 0.87; Z\u2009=\u20094.24, P\u2009<\u20090.001; fixed-effect model), whereas HMB supplementation combined with exercise intervention showed no additional fat-free mass change (effect size: 0.06; 95% CI -\u00a00.26, 0.38; Z\u2009=\u20090.38, P\u2009=\u20090.705; Fixed-effect model). HMB supplementation is beneficial for improving body composition in older people. However, the effect of HMB supplementation combined with exercise therapy to improve muscle mass is not obvious. Exercise programs need to be designed according to the different physical health of older people.",

          "content": "Holland, BM, Roberts, BM, Krieger, JW, and Schoenfeld, BJ. Does HMB enhance body composition in athletes? A systematic review and meta-analysis. J Strength Cond Res 36(2): 585-592, 2022-The purpose of this article was to systematically review and meta-analyze the current literature to determine the effects of HMB on body composition in athletes. Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) were an experimental design published in a peer-reviewed, English-language journal; (b) included human athletic populations; (c) assessed body mass (BM), fat mass (FM), or fat-free mass (FFM) using a validated measure; (d) and had a minimum supplementation period of 4 weeks. Separate analyses were performed for BM, FM, and FFM using robust variance random-effects meta-regression for multilevel data structures, with adjustments for small samples. The final analysis of BM comprised a total of 208 subjects from 7 studies. Analysis of FFM and FM encompassed 5 studies comprising 161 subjects and 5 studies comprising 128 subjects, respectively. The principal finding of this analysis suggests HMB may have a small, positive impact on FFM in athletes (0.30 \u00b1 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.07 to 0.68; p = 0.08), although this seems specific to when protein intake is suboptimal (<1.6 g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1). Consistent with previous research on athletes, HMB demonstrated no significant effect on BM (-0.02 \u00b1 0.04; 95% CI: -0.14 to 0.10; p = 0.70) and a small, nonsignificant effect on FM (-0.33 \u00b1 0.23; 95% CI: -0.96 to 0.31; p = 0.22). More research is required to establish HMB's influence on FFM in athletes. It is also important to consider the dosage of HMB and training parameters of athletes because these will likely influence the efficacy of supplementation.",

          "content": "Muscular damage sustained while playing rugby may hinder performance across a season. \u03b2-Hydroxy \u03b2-Methylbutyrate (HMB) may help attenuate muscle damage and maintain lean mass and performance. This study sought to determine the effect of combining HMB with creatine monohydrate supplementation on measures of stress and muscle damage, body composition, strength and sprinting kinetics throughout a rugby season. This double-blind, cross-over investigation recruited 16 male collegiate rugby players to provide resting blood samples and complete assessments of body composition, strength and sprinting performance prior to their fall season (PRE). After testing, the athletes were matched for fat-free mass and assigned to consume one of two supplementation regimens for 6\u2009weeks: 5\u2009g HMB\u2009+\u20095\u2009g creatine per day (HMB-Cr: 20.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009years; 177\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009cm; 88.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u2009kg) or 5\u2009g creatine +\u20095\u2009g placebo per day (Cr: 21.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009years; 179\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009cm; 88.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u2009kg). After 6\u2009weeks (POST), PRE testing was repeated in 13 of the original 16 athletes before a 10-wk wash-out period. Athletes who returned for the spring season (n\u2009=\u20098) repeated all fall-season procedures and testing prior to (PRE) and following (POST) their 6-wk spring season, except they were assigned to the opposite supplementation regimen. Linear mixed models with repeated measures revealed group x time interactions (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.05) for observed for several measures but did not consistently and positively favor one group. During the fall season, knee extensor peak torque was reduced by 40.7\u2009\u00b1\u200928.1\u2009Nm (p\u2009=\u20090.035) for HMB-Cr but remained consistent for Cr, and no group differences or changes were noted in the spring. In the spring, greater knee flexor rate of torque development (~\u2009149\u2009Nm\u00b7sec, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and impulse (~\u20094.5\u2009Nm\u00b7sec, p\u2009=\u20090.022) were observed in Cr at PRE but not at POST. Although significant interactions were found for cortisol concentrations, vastus lateralis pennation angle, and sprinting force, post-hoc analysis only revealed differences between fall and spring seasons. No other differences were observed. The combination of HMB and creatine monohydrate supplementation does not provide a greater ergogenic benefit compared to creatine monohydrate supplementation alone. Body composition, strength, and sprinting ability did not change across the season with creatine monohydrate supplementation.",

          "content": "Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a popular supplement in the resistance training community, with its use supported by claims of increased strength, muscle growth, and improved recovery; however, research outcomes are variable. Therefore, we meta-analyzed the effectiveness of HMB on strength, body composition, and muscle damage. Nine qualifying studies yielded 14 comparisons subcategorized by training experience (trained, untrained) to provide 12-13 estimates of strength (upper body, lower body, overall average), 13 estimates of fat and fat-free mass, and 7 estimates of the muscle-damage marker creatine kinase. The meta-analysis comprised 394 subjects (age 23 +/- 2 years, mean +/- between-study SD) with 5 +/- 2 weeks' intervention and 5 +/- 6 h.wk of training. The estimates were analyzed using a meta-analytic mixed model with study sample size as the weighting factor that included the main-effect covariates to control for between-study differences in HMB dose, intervention duration, training load, and dietary cointervention. To interpret magnitudes, meta-analyzed effects were standardized using the composite baseline between-subject SD and were qualified using modified Cohen effect size thresholds. There were small benefits to lower-body (mean +/- 90% confidence limit: 9.9% +/- 5.9%) and average strength (6.6 +/- 5.7%), but only negligible gains for upper-body strength (2.1 +/- 5.5%) were observed in untrained lifters. In trained lifters, all strength outcomes were trivial. Combined (all studies), the overall average strength increase was trivial (3.7 +/- 2.4%), although uncertainty allows for a small benefit. Effects on fat and fat-free mass were trivial, and results regarding creatine kinase were unclear. Supplementation with HMB during resistance training incurs small but clear overall and leg strength gains in previously untrained men, but effects in trained lifters are trivial. The HMB effect on body composition is inconsequential. An explanation for strength gains in previously untrained lifters requires further research.",

          "content": "\u03b2-Hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB), a leucine metabolite, can increase skeletal muscle size and function. However, HMB may be less effective at improving muscle function in people with insufficient Vitamin D3 (25-OH-D < 30 ng/mL) which is common in middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that combining HMB plus Vitamin D3 (HMB + D) supplementation would improve skeletal muscle size, composition, and function in middle-aged women. In a double-blinded fashion, women (53 \u00b1 1 yrs, 26 \u00b1 1 kg/m2, n = 43) were randomized to take placebo or HMB + D (3 g Calcium HMB + 2000 IU D per day) during 12 weeks of sedentary behavior (SED) or resistance exercise training (RET). On average, participants entered the study Vitamin D3 insufficient while HMB + D increased 25-OH-D to sufficient levels after 8 and 12 weeks. In SED, HMB + D prevented the loss of arm lean mass observed with placebo. HMB + D increased muscle volume and decreased intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) volume in the thigh compared to placebo but did not change muscle function. In RET, 12-weeks of HMB + D decreased IMAT compared to placebo but did not influence the increase in skeletal muscle volume or function. In summary, HMB + D decreased IMAT independent of exercise status and may prevent the loss or increase muscle size in a small cohort of sedentary middle-aged women. These results lend support to conduct a longer duration study with greater sample size to determine the validity of the observed positive effects of HMB + D on IMAT and skeletal muscle in a small cohort of middle-aged women.",

          "content": "The maintenance of muscle mass and muscle strength is important for reducing the risk of chronic diseases. The age- related loss of muscle mass and strength is associated with adverse outcomes of physical disability, frailty and death. \u03b2-Hydroxy \u03b2-Methyl Butyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, has beneficial effects on muscle mass and strength under various catabolic conditions. The objectives of the present study were to determine if age- related differences existed in endogenous plasma HMB levels, and to assess if HMB levels correlated to total appendicular lean mass and forearm grip strength. Anthropometry, dietary and physical activity assessment, and the estimation of fasting plasma HMB concentrations and handgrip strength were performed on the 305 subjects (children, young adults and older adults). Lean mass, which serves as a surrogate for muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Mean plasma HMB concentrations were significantly lower with increasing age groups, with children having highest mean HMB concentration (p<0.01) followed by young adults and older adults. Female subjects (across all ages) had significantly lower plasma HMB concentrations. A significant positive correlation between HMB concentrations and appendicular lean mass normalized for body weight (%), appendicular lean mass (r=0.37; p<0.001) was observed in the young adults and older adults group. Handgrip strength was positively associated with plasma HMB concentrations in young adults (r=0.58; p<0.01) and the older adults group (r=0.28; p<0.01). The findings of the present study suggest that there is an age- related decline in endogenous HMB concentrations in humans and the HMB concentrations were positively correlated with appendicular lean mass and hand grip strength in young adults and older adults group.",

Plasma creatine phosphokinase was also decreased with HMB supplementation (week 3, linear decrease, P < 0.05). Weight lifted was increased by HMB supplementation when compared with the unsupplemented subjects during each week of the study (linear increase, P < 0.02). In study 2, fat-free mass was significantly increased in HMB-supplemented subjects compared with the unsupplemented group at 2 and 4-6 wk of the study (P < 0.05).

          "content": "Creatine monohydrate (CrM) and \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) are common ergogenic aids in the field of sports and are frequently used in an isolated way. However, there are a few studies that have investigated the effect of combining both supplements on different variables related to performance, with controversial results. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and the degree of potentiation of 10 weeks of CrM plus HMB supplementation on sports performance, which was measured by an incremental test to exhaustion in elite male traditional rowers. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 10-week study, participants ( = 28) were randomized to a placebo group (PLG;  = 7), CrM group (0.04 g/kg/day of CrM;  = 7), HMB group (3 g/day of HMB;  = 7) and CrM-HMB group (0.04 g/kg/day of CrM plus 3 g/day of HMB;  = 7). Before and after 10 weeks of different treatments, an incremental test was performed on a rowing ergometer to calculate the power that each rower obtained at the anaerobic threshold (WAT), and at 4 mmol (W4) and 8 mmol (W8) of blood lactate concentration. There were no significant differences in WAT and W4 among groups or in body composition. However, it was observed that the aerobic power achieved at W8 was significantly higher in the CrM-HMB group than in the PLG, CrM and HMB groups ( < 0.001; \u03b72 = 0.766). Likewise, a synergistic effect of combined supplementation was found for the sum of the two supplements separately at WAT (CrM-HMBG = 403.19% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 337.52%), W4 (CrM-HMBG = 2736.17% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 1705.32%) and W8 (CrM-HMBG = 1293.4% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 877.56%). In summary, CrM plus HMB supplementation over 10 weeks showed a synergistic effect on aerobic power (measured as WAT, W4, and W8) during an incremental test but had no influence muscle mass.",

          "content": "Although beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine (Arg), and glutamine (Gln) may contribute to wound healing, no prospective studies have investigated the efficacy of a compound consisting of HMB, Arg, and Gln (HMB/Arg/Gln) for reducing wound complications following open abdominal surgery. This study evaluates the usefulness of perioperative nutrition using HMB/Arg/Gln in patients who were scheduled to undergo open surgery for abdominal malignancies in a randomized controlled trial. Patients scheduled for open surgery for abdominal malignancies were randomized to receive HMB/Arg/Gln (1.2 g HMB, 7 g L-Arg, and 7 g L-Gln) or placebo (isocaloric juice). The supplements were provided once daily for 3 days preoperatively and once daily for 7 days postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the incidence of wound complications. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of other complications, postoperative duration of hospital stay, total-body skeletal muscle mass, handgrip strength, and skin water content. Sixty-one patients were randomly assigned to either the HMB/Arg/Gln (n = 31) or the placebo (n = 30) group. One patient in the HMB/Arg/Gln group was ineligible because laparoscopic surgery was performed; thus, 60 patients were analyzed. The incidence of wound complications (20%) was the same in both groups (P = 1.000). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other complications, body composition, handgrip strength, or skin water content between the 2 groups. Serum growth hormone (GH) levels were significantly higher for patients whose total intake was > 80% of planned volume in the HMB/Arg/Gln group. The incidence of wound complications would not be reduced by perioperative HMB/Arg/Gln administration in patients who underwent open surgery. The efficacy of HMB/Arg/Gln for increasing serum GH levels needs to be validated in another large-scale randomized controlled trial.",

Outcomes investigated were: total body mass (TBM), FFM, fat mass (FM), total single repetition maximum (1RM), bench press (BP) 1RM, and lower body (LwB) 1RM. Databases consulted were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (Embase), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SportDiscus. Fourteen studies fit the inclusion criteria; however, 11 were analyzed after data extraction and funnel plot analysis exclusion. A total of 302 participants (18-45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 248 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes. We conclude that HMB produces a small effect on TBM gain, but this effect does not translate into significantly greater increases in FFM, strength or decreases in FM during periods of RET. Our findings do not support the use of HMB aiming at improvement of body composition or strength with RET.",

          "content": "Frailty is a key element in healthy ageing in which muscle performance plays a main role. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation has shown favourable effects in modulating protein synthesis, improving muscle mass and function in interventional studies. Decreased age-related endogenous HMB levels have been shown in previous studies. The aim of the present study is to assess whether there is an association between endogenous plasma HMB levels and frailty. Data from 1290 subjects (56.98% women; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation age 74.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.95\u00a0years) from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging were obtained. Participants had their frailty status qualified according to Fried's Frailty Phenotype (FFP) score and the Frailty Trait Scale in its 12-domain version (FTS-12). Plasma HMB levels were analysed by an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Differences between groups (frail vs. non-frail) were tested using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-squared test. The association between HMB and frailty was assessed by multivariate linear and logistic regressions when frailty was analysed as continuous and binary, respectively. Models were adjusted by age, gender, comorbidity, body composition and protein intake. HMB levels were lower in those aged \u226575\u00a0years than in those aged 65-74\u00a0years, with an inverse linear relationship between age and HMB levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.031; P\u00a0=\u00a00.018), mainly accounted by males (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.062; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). HMB levels were higher in men (0.238\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.065 vs. 0.193\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.051\u00a0ng/mL; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). HMB levels were significantly lower in frail than in non-frail individuals: 0.204\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.058 versus 0.217\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.063\u00a0ng/dL (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) according to the FFP and 0.203\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.059 versus 0.219\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.063\u00a0ng/mL (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) according to FTS-12. These differences showed a dose-dependent profile when we compared them by quintiles of HMB (P for trend: 0.022; 0.012 and 0.0004, respectively, for FFP, FTS-12 binary and FTS-12 continuous). Variables associated with low HMB levels were body mass index, strength, exhaustion and weight loss. Frailty was associated with HMB levels in all the adjusted models, including the fully adjusted ones, no matter the tool used (odds ratio: 0.45 [0.26, 0.77] for FFP and 0.36 [0.20, 0.63] for FTS-12 binary; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-4.76 [-7.29, -2.23] for FTS-12 score). This association was also observed when the analyses were done by quintiles, showing such association since Q4 (FFP), Q2 (FTS-12 binary) and Q3 (FTS-12 score). The associations were observed in the whole sample and in each gender. There is an inverse association between HMB levels and frailty status. These findings support the design of targeted clinical trials to evaluate the effect of HMB supplementation in older frail people with low HMB levels.",

This secondary analysis aimed to test whether \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation enhances the effects of resistance training (RT) on MQ in older women with low muscle mass. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-by-two factorial design trial was conducted at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. Women age 65-79 yr with a skeletal muscle mass index of <5.7 kg\u00b7m-2 were randomly allocated to one of four arms (RT + HMB, RT + placebo, education + HMB, and education + placebo). Participants attended supervised RT sessions twice weekly or education programs every 2 wk and were provided calcium-HMB (1500 mg) or placebo supplements once daily for 12 wk. The main outcomes were changes in functional MQ, assessed by knee extension strength per quadriceps thickness, and compositional MQ, assessed by the echo intensity of the rectus femoris muscle. Overall, 156 and 149 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments, respectively. Two-factorial analysis of variance showed no significant interaction of HMB supplementation with RT in terms of functional or compositional MQ. Main-effects analyses revealed that the decline in functional MQ of the group performing RT was smaller by 0.71 N\u00b7mm-1 (95% confidence interval, 0.11-1.31) compared with that in the education group. No significant main effects of RT or HMB supplementation on compositional MQ were observed. HMB supplementation did not enhance the treatment effects of RT for either MQ parameter; however, RT reduced the decline in functional MQ. Thus, adding HMB supplementation to RT is not significantly useful for improving MQ in this population.",

Therefore, a 24-week, prospective randomized open blinded-endpoint trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplementation of 8 g of BCAA or 7.5 g of soy protein on skeletal muscle and glycemic control as well as adverse events in elderly individuals with T2D. Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to the BCAA group ( = 21) and the soy protein group ( = 15). Skeletal muscle mass and HbA1c, which were primary endpoints, did not change over time or differ between groups. However, knee extension muscle strength was significantly increased in the soy protein group and showed a tendency to increase in the BCAA group. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance did not significantly change during the trial. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved in the BCAA group but the difference between groups was not significant. Results suggested that BCAA supplementation may not affect skeletal muscle mass and glycemic control and may improve depressive symptoms in elderly individuals with T2D.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia is a disease of old age characterized by decreased muscle mass and strength. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) promote muscle mass synthesis and increase muscle strength. We aimed to develop a dietary amino acid database and to examine the association between BCAA intake and handgrip strength in Korean older adults. Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2014-2018 were used. Overall, 4852 participants aged \u226565 years were included in the study. Demographic, lifestyle, and health data were obtained through interviews and questionnaires. The 24-h recall method was used to assess dietary intake. An amino acid database was established using the 9th revision of the Korean Standard Food Composition Table. The mean handgrip strength was estimated from triplicate measurements obtained using the dominant hand. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between BCAA intake and handgrip strength. Grains greatly contributed to amino acid intake; however, a significant negative association was observed between handgrip strength and increased BCAA intake through grains. In the fully adjusted model, leucine intake and handgrip strength showed a positive association. Thus, consuming BCAAs (especially leucine) via a variety of food sources can help maintain muscle health in older people.",

          "content": "Physical frailty is related with morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Currently, there is no approved treatment of frailty in these patients. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of 16 weeks branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) supplementation on frailty in frail compensated cirrhotic patients. After a 4-week run-in period consisted of dietary and exercise counseling, compensated cirrhotic patients with frailty, defined by liver frailty index (LFI)\u22654.5, were randomly assigned (1:1) to BCAA or control group. The BCAA group received twice daily BCAAs supplementation (210\u00a0kcal, protein 13.5\u00a0g, BCAA 2.03\u00a0g) for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was frailty reversion. The secondary outcomes were changes in biochemistries, body composition evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and quality of life (QoL). 54 patients were prospectively enrolled (age 65.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.9 years, 51.9% female, Child-Pugh A/B 68.5%/31.5%, MELD 10.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1). Baseline characteristics were similar between both groups. At week 16, BCAA group had a significant improvement in LFI (-0.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 vs. -0.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.28, P\u2009=\u20090.01), BMI (+\u20090.51\u2009\u00b1\u20091.19 vs. -0.49\u2009\u00b1\u20091.89\u00a0kg/m, P\u2009=\u20090.03), and serum albumin (+\u20090.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27 vs. +0.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u00a0g/dl, P\u2009=\u20090.01). The proportion of frailty reversion at week 16 was significantly higher in BCAA group (36% vs. 0%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Compared with baseline, BCAA group had a significant increase in skeletal muscle index (7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 to 7.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u00a0kg/m, P\u2009=\u20090.03). Regarding the QoL, only the BCAA group had a significant improvement in all 4 domains of physical component score of the SF-36 questionnaire. A 16-week BCAA supplementation improved frailty in frail compensated cirrhotic patients. In addition, this intervention resulted in an improvement of muscle mass and physical domain of QoL in these patients.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of BCAA supplementation on sarcopenia measures in patients with cirrhosis. We conducted a 12-month double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial of BCAA supplementation (30\u2009g daily) compared to an equicaloric, equi-nitrogenous whey protein in volunteers with cirrhosis and reduced muscle strength. The primary endpoint was an increase in grip strength and upper limb lean mass measured on DEXA. Mean-adjusted differences (MAD, 95% CI) between groups at 6 and 12 months are reported as treatment effect using a linear mixed model for repeated measures. A total of 150 volunteers entered the trial (74 BCAA, 76 control), with a median age of 58\u2009years [IQR 48; 63] and MELD of 14 [12; 17]. At 12 months, 57% in the BCAA arm and 61% in the control arm met the primary endpoint (p\u2009=\u20090.80). No significant between-group difference was found in grip strength (MAD -0.15\u2009kg [-0.37; 0.06], p\u2009=\u20090.29) or upper limb lean mass (1.7\u2009kg [-0.2; 3.6], p\u2009=\u20090.22) at 12 months. No significant differences in other body composition parameters, physical performance, frailty, rates of hospitalisation or mortality were found between the BCAA and the control group. Fatigue improved across the entire cohort, without significant between-group differences. 15% of volunteers reported side effects, with distaste higher in the BCAA arm (p\u2009=\u20090.045). BCAA supplementation did not improve measures of muscle strength, mass or performance or physical frailty compared to a whey protein supplement in a randomised controlled setting.

This investigation aimed to determine FFM and plasma AA responses to military training, examine whether adaptations differ between male and female recruits, and explore potential associations between FFM and AA responses to training. Body composition and plasma AA levels were assessed in US Army recruits (n = 209, 118 males, 91 females) before (baseline) and every three weeks during basic combat training (BCT), a 10-week military training course. Body weight decreased in men but remained stable in women during BCT (sex-by-time interaction, P < 0.05). Fifty-eight percent of recruits gained FFM during BCT, with more (P < 0.05) females (88%) gaining FFM than males (36%). Total plasma AA increased (P < 0.05) during BCT, with greater (P < 0.05) increases observed in females (17%) then in males (4%). Essential amino acids (EAA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) were increased (P < 0.05) in females but did not change in males (sex-by-time interaction, P < 0.05). Independent of sex, changes in EAA (r = 0.34) and BCAA (r = 0.27) from baseline were associated with changes in FFM (P < 0.05); greater (P < 0.05) increases in AA concentrations were observed for those who gained FFM. Increases in FFM and plasma AA suggest that BCT elicits a more pronounced anabolic response in women compared to men, which may reflect sex-specific differences in the relative intensity of the combined training and physiological stimulus associated with BCT.",

Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a high-protein diet (HPD) or isolated branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) intake is associated with an increased skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) in patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. This cross-sectional, observational study included 106 patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors. Food consumption was estimated using 24-h food recall. Patients were divided into two groups: a low-protein diet (LPD) group (\u22641.2 g \u00b7 kg \u00b7 d) and a high-protein diet (HPD) group (>1.2 g \u00b7 kg \u00b7 d). Appendicular muscle mass (ASM) was calculated using Lee's formula, and its values were divided by the square of the height of the patient to obtain SMI values. Differences were considered significant when the probability they occurred by chance was <5% (P < 0.05). Of 106 patients assessed, 69 (65%) consumed a diet consistent with specifications of the LPD group and 37 (35%) consumed a diet consistent with HPD intake. Logistic regression after adjusting for sex and caloric and carbohydrate consumption showed an association between SMI and HPD (odds ratio, 4.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-16.56; P < 0.001) but not with BCAA. Daily total protein intake, but not isolated BCAA or leucine, was able to predict an increase in SMI in 43% of patients considered (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Thus, HPD was associated with SMI, and total protein intake was a better predictor of SMI than BCAAs. HPD is a cost-effective way to enhance SMI, rather than focusing on the ingestion of isolated BCAAs.",

This post hoc analysis of a controlled double-blind randomized crossover study assessed the impact of BCAAs on nutritional status, physical function, and quality of life. We included 36 chronic HD patient features of protein energy wasting as plasma albumin <38\u00a0g/L, and dietary intakes <30\u00a0kcal/kg/day and <1\u00a0g protein/kg/day. Patients received either oral BCAA (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0g/day) or glycine (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0g/day) for 4\u00a0months (Period 1), followed by a washout period of 1\u00a0month, and then received the opposite supplement (Period 2). The outcomes were lean body mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, fat-free mass index measured by bioelectrical impedance, resting energy expenditure, dietary intake and appetite rating, physical activity and function, quality of life, and blood parameters. Analyses were performed by multiple mixed linear regressions including type of supplementation, months, period, sex, and age as fixed effects and subjects as random intercepts. Twenty-seven patients (61.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.7\u00a0years, 41% women) were compliant to the supplementations (consumption >80% of packs) and completed the study.

BCAA and glycine intake had no effect on the other clinical parameters, blood chemistry tests, or plasma amino acids. Branched-chain amino acid did not improve lean body mass as compared with glycine. Unexpectedly, glycine improved fat-free mass index in HD patients, as compared with BCAA.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with LC, and to test the association between sarcopenia and patient outcomes. We also analyzed the effect of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation on sarcopenic LC. Clinical and blood biochemical data of 130 patients with LC who underwent abdominal computed tomography scan were analyzed in this retrospective study. The cross-sectional area of skeletal muscles was measured at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on the scan. The skeletal muscle index was calculated to identify sarcopenia. Cirrhotic patients who were treated with BCAA supplementation of 12 g/d for \u2265 1 y were defined as the BCAA group, and the effect of BCAA on sarcopenic LC was evaluated. Sixty-eight percent of all patients (82% of men and 50% of women) were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Male sex (P = 0.01) and body mass index (P < 0.0001) were predictors of sarcopenia. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model found BCAA supplementation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; P = 0.01), sarcopenia (HR, 3.03; P < 0.01), and Child-Pugh classes B (HR, 2.39; P = 0.03) and C (HR, 5.49; P < 0.001) to be independently associated with mortality. The mortality of sarcopenic LC was significantly higher than that of non-sarcopenic LC (P = 0.01). Moreover, BCAA supplementation improved the survival of sarcopenic patients in subgroup analysis (P < 0.01). Sarcopenia is significantly associated with mortality in patients with LC. BCAA supplementation might be associated with improved survival of such patients.",

          "content": "To investigate the effects of continuous intervention with branched chain amino acids-enriched nutritional supplements from the acute phase to convalescent rehabilitation wards in inpatients with gait impairments. Open-label, randomized, parallel-group comparison study (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry ID: UMIN000018640). Acute care and convalescent rehabilitation wards. We studied 80 patients undergoing stand/gait training. Participants in the intervention group (RJ group) received nutritional supplements (jelly foods comprising 2500 mg BCAA and 20 IU vitamin D) twice a day until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the motor components of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM-m), and the secondary outcome was skeletal muscle mass index. Analyses were conducted on 55 patients who were able to perform stand/gait training continuously from the acute until the recovery phases. FIM-m was significantly elevated in the RJ group and the control group , but no difference was noted between the two groups. Only the RJ group showed a significant increase in skeletal muscle mass index, and the amount of variation was significantly different between the two groups (the control group decreased an average of 2.2% and the RJ group increased an average of 4.3%; P = 0.014). A significant decrease in body weight was found only in the control group (P = 0.084). Nutritional interventions using branched chain amino acids (BCAA)-enriched nutritional supplements demonstrated no significant difference in activities of daily living; however, an increase in skeletal muscle mass was noted. Skeletal muscle mass and body weight differed significantly between the two groups, and BCAA-enriched nutritional supplements intake in acute and convalescent rehabilitation wards may be effective for the prevention of malnutrition and sarcopenia.",

This is a pilot, prospective, randomized, and double-blind study of a cohort of 32 patients with cirrhosis and sarcopenia diagnosed by computed tomography scan who underwent a nutritional and physical activity intervention for 12 weeks. They were divided into 2 groups (placebo: 17 patients; BCAA: 15 patients). The study protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04073693). Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. After treatment, only the BCAA group presented a significant improvement in muscle mass (43.7 vs 46 cm2/m2; P = 0.023). Seventeen patients (63%) presented improvement in muscle mass overall, which was more frequent in the BCAA group (83.3 vs 46.7%; P = 0.056). Regarding frailty, there was a significant improvement in the Liver Frailty Index in the global cohort (n = 32) after the 12 weeks (4.2 vs 3.9; P < 0.001). This difference was significant in both groups: in the placebo group (4.2 vs 3.8; P < 0.001) and in the BCAA group (4.2 vs 3.9; P < 0.001). After treatment, the BCAA group had a higher increase in zinc levels than the placebo group (\u0394zinc: 12.3 vs 5.5; P = 0.026). In addition, there was a trend for greater improvement of albumin levels in the BCAA group (\u0394albumin: 0.19 vs 0.04; P = 0.091).

          "title": "Adding Branched-Chain Amino Acids and Vitamin D to Whey Protein Is More Effective than Protein Alone in Preserving Fat Free Mass and Muscle Strength in the First Month after Sleeve Gastrectomy.",
          "content": "Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is one of the most commonly performed weight loss (WL) bariatric procedures. The main goal of WL is reducing total body weight (TBW) and fat mass (FM). However, TBW loss is systematically accompanied by a decline in fat-free mass (FFM), predominantly in the first post-surgical month, despite protein supplementation. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and vitamin D seem to attenuate loss of FFM and, thus, reduce the decline in muscle strength (MS). However, data on the role of an integrated supplementation with whey protein plus BCAAs plus vitamin D (P+BCAAs+Vit.D) vs. protein alone on total weight loss (TWL), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and (MS) in the first month after SG are lacking. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the impact of P+BCAAs+Vit.D vs. protein alone supplementation on TWL, FM, FFM, and MS in the first month after SG. Before SG and at 1 month afterward, we prospectively measured and compared TBW, FM, FFM, and MS in 57 patients who received either a supplementation with P+BCAAs+Vit.D (n = 31) or protein alone (n = 26). The impact of P+BCAAs+Vit.D and protein alone supplementation on clinical status was also evaluated. Despite non-significant variation in TBW, FM decreased more significantly (18.5% vs. 13.2%,  = 0.023) with the P+BCAA+Vit.D supplementation compared to protein alone. Furthermore, the P+BCAA+Vit.D group showed a significantly lower decrease in FFM (4.1% vs. 11.4%,  < 0.001) and MS (3.8% vs. 18.5%,  < 0.001) compared to the protein alone group. No significant alterations in clinical status were seen in either group. P+BCAA+Vit.D supplementation is more effective than protein alone in determining FM loss and is associated with a lower decrease in FFM and MS, without interfering with clinical status in patients 1 month after SG.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia, the age-related decrease in muscle mass and function can result in adverse health outcomes and subsequent loss of independence. Inadequate nutrition is an important contributor to the aetiology of sarcopenia, and dietary strategies are studied to prevent or delay this geriatric syndrome. The present study investigated whether there is an association between biochemical nutrient status markers, muscle parameters and sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. Data from the cross-sectional Maastricht Sarcopenia study (MaSS) were used, in which skeletal muscle index (SMI), 4 meter gait speed, 5 times chair stand and handgrip strength were assessed among older adults (n=227). Sarcopenia was defined following the algorithm of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Fasted blood samples were analyses on amino acids levels, RBC phospholipid profile, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), \u03b1-tocopherol, magnesium and homocysteine were determined in fasted blood levels. Generalized linear modelling and logistic regression were used for data analysis. Lower blood levels of essential amino acids (EAA), total branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and leucine were associated with lower SMI (P<0.001), strength (P<0.001) and longer time to complete the chair stand (P<0.05), whereas no association was found for total amino acids (TAA). Lower levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 25(OH)D and homocysteine were associated with lower muscle parameter values (P<0.05). No significant associations were found for SFA, MUFA, PUFA, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), \u03b1-tocopherol-cholesterol ratio and magnesium. Sarcopenia was more frequent among those with lower levels of leucine, BCAA, EAA, EPA, 25(OH)D and higher levels of homocysteine (P<0.05). Age and BMI were identified as relevant covariates. A robust association was only found for lower gait speed and lower 25(OH)D levels. Compromised muscle parameters are associated with low blood values of specific amino acids, fatty acids, vitamin D and high homocysteine.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia is thought to be related to the microbiome, but not enough reports in chronic liver disease (CLD) patients. In addition to the differences in microbiome, the role of the microbiome in the gut is also important to be clarified because it has recently been shown that the microbiome may produce branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in the body. In this single-center study, sixty-nine CLD patients were divided by skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) into low (L-SMI: n\u2009=\u200925) and normal (N-SMI: n\u2009=\u200944). Microbiome was analyzed from stool samples based on V3-4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA). L-SMI had a lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio than N-SMI. At the genus level, Coprobacillus, Catenibacterium and Clostridium were also lower while the Bacteroides was higher. Predictive functional profiling of the L-SMI group showed that genes related to nitrogen metabolism were enriched, but those related to amino acid metabolism, including BCAA biosynthesis, were lower. The genes related to 'LPS biosynthesis' was also higher. The microbiome of CLD patients with low muscle mass is characterized not only by high relative abundance of gram-negative bacteria with LPS, but also by the possibility of low potential for amino acid synthesis including BCAAs.",

          "content": "Aging is a multifactorial process characterized by several features including low-grade inflammation, increased oxidative stress and reduced regenerative capacity, which ultimately lead to alteration in morpho-functional properties of skeletal muscle, thus promoting sarcopenia. This condition is characterized by a gradual loss of muscle mass due to an unbalance between protein synthesis and degradation, finally conveying in functional decline and disability. The development of specific therapeutic approaches able to block or reverse this condition may represent an invaluable tool for the promotion of a healthy aging among elderly people. It is well established that changes in the quantity and the quality of dietary proteins, as well as the intake of specific amino acids, are able to counteract some of the physiopathological processes related to the progression of the loss of muscle mass and may have beneficial effects in improving the anabolic response of muscle in the elderly. Taurine is a non-essential amino acid expressed in high concentration in several mammalian tissues and particularly in skeletal muscle where it is involved in the modulation of intracellular calcium concentration and ion channel regulation and where it also acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory factor. The aim of this review is to summarize the pleiotropic effects of taurine on specific muscle targets and to discuss its role in regulating signaling pathways involved in the maintenance of muscle homeostasis. We also highlight the potential use of taurine as a therapeutic molecule for the amelioration of skeletal muscle function and performance severely compromised during aging.",

          "content": "Skeletal muscle wasting, associated with aging, may be regulated by the inflammatory cytokines as well as by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). l-carnitine possesses anti-inflammatory properties and increases plasma IGF-1 concentration, leading to the regulation of the genes responsible for protein catabolism and anabolism. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a 24-week l-carnitine supplementation on serum inflammatory markers, IGF-1, body composition and skeletal muscle strength in healthy human subjects over 65 years of age. Women between 65 and 70 years of age were supplemented for 24 weeks with either 1500 mg l-carnitine-l-tartrate or an isonitrogenous placebo per day in a double-blind fashion. Before and after the supplementation protocol, body mass and composition, as well as knee extensor and flexor muscle strength were determined. In the blood samples, free carnitine, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, C-reactive protein and IGF-1 were determined. A marked increase in free plasma carnitine concentration was observed due to l-carnitine supplementation. No substantial changes in other parameters were noted. In the current study, supplementation for 24 weeks affected neither the skeletal muscle strength nor circulating markers in healthy women over 65 years of age. Positive and negative aspects of l-carnitine supplementation need to be clarified.",

Thus, we examined the different effects of l-carnitine and exercise on exercise activity and muscle status in hemodialysis patients. Twenty patients were divided into l-carnitine and cycle ergometer groups and were followed for 3\u2009months. Muscle and fat mass, physical activities, and muscle status were evaluated by an impedance, physical function test, and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. The l-carnitine significantly increased muscle mass (P = .023) and thigh circumference (P = .027), decreased fat mass (P = .007), and shortened chair stand-up time (P = .002) and 10-m walk test (P = .037). The fat fraction was improved by the l-carnitine (P = .047). Compared with the exercise group, l-carnitine improved the changes in 10-m walk test (P = .026), chair stand-up time (P = .014), and thigh circumference (P = .022).

A nationwide screening program identified 76 Faroese adult patients (15-80\u00a0years) with Primary Carnitine Deficiency (PCD). We describe prior and current health status and symptoms in these patients, especially focusing on cardiac characteristics. Upon identification, patients were immediately admitted for physical examination, ECG, blood tests and initiation of L-carnitine supplementation. Medical records were reviewed and patients were interviewed. Echocardiography and blood tests were performed in 35 patients before and after L-carnitine supplementation. All patients were either asymptomatic or had minor symptoms when diagnosed. Echocardiography including LVEF, global longitudinal strain and dimensions were normal apart from left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function in one young male. Symptoms, e.g. fatigue, were reported in 43\u00a0% with a reduction to 12\u00a0% (p\u2009<\u20090.01) following initiation of L-carnitine supplementation. Eighty two\u00a0% reported participation in sports of which 52\u00a0% were on a competitive level. ECGs showed limited changes and blood tests were normal. Mean plasma free carnitine increased from 6.1\u00a0\u03bcmol/L to 15.1\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (p\u2009<\u20090.01) within 50\u00a0days of L-carnitine supplementation.

          "content": "The current study was designed to examine whether a combination of three nutrients, consisting of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, L-glutamine (Gln) and L-arginine (Arg), each of which has been previously shown to slow muscle proteolysis, could synergistically alter the course of muscle wasting in patients with established acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Sixty-eight human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with a documented weight loss of at least 5% in the previous 3 months were recruited from the HIV clinic at Nassau County Medical Center. The subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive either placebo containing maltodextrin or the nutrient mixture (HMB/Arg/Gln) containing 3 g HMB, 14 g L-glutamine, and 14 g L-arginine given in two divided doses daily for 8 weeks. Body weights (BW) were recorded weekly and lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass (FM) were measured by air displacement plethysmography and by a single computerized tomography (CT) slice through the thigh at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. Forty-three subjects completed the 8-week protocol, (placebo, n = 21; HMB/Arg/Gln, n = 22). At 8 weeks, the subjects consuming the HMB/Arg/Gln mixture gained 3.0 +/- 0.5 kg of BW while those supplemented with the placebo gained 0.37 +/- 0.84 kg (p = .009). The BW gain in the HMB/Arg/Gln-treated subjects was predominantly LBM (2.55 +/- 0.75 kg) compared with the placebo-supplemented subjects who lost lean mass (-0.70 +/- 0.69 kg, p = .003). No significant change in FM gain was observed (0.43 +/- 0.83 kg for the group receiving HMB/Arg/Gln and 1.07 +/- 0.64 kg for the group receiving the placebo, p > .20). Similar percentage changes in muscle mass and fat mass were observed with CT scans. Immune status was also improved as evident by an increase in CD3 and CD8 cells and a decrease in the HIV viral load with HMB/Arg/Gln supplementation. The data indicate that the HMB/Arg/Gln mixture can markedly alter the course of lean tissue loss in patients with AIDS-associated wasting.",

          "content": "The consumption of dietary amino acids has been evaluated for therapeutic and safety intervention in obesity. In particular, three molecules have been shown to be effective: arginine, glutamine and leucine (and its metabolite beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, HMB). This randomized, double-blinded pilot study in obese postmenopausal patients aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the administration of a specific food for special medical purposes (FSMP) consisting of arginine, glutamine and HMB on body composition, in particular, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), as the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate the effects on skin health through a validated self-reported questionnaire. A significant improvement on VAT of \u0394 = -153.600,  = 0.01 was recorded in the intervention group. Skin health showed a significant improvement in the treatment group for the following: bright \u0394 = 1.400 (0.758; 2.042), elasticity \u0394 = 0.900 (0.239; 1.561), wrinkles \u0394 = 0.800 (0.276; 1.324), and on total score, \u0394 = 3.000 (1.871; 4.129). In the intervention group, the improvement in VAT was associated with an improvement in the bright score (r = -0.58;  = 0.01). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the intake for 4-weeks of arginine, glutamine and HMB effects a significant reduction in VAT and improves skin condition, while fat free mass (FFM) is maintained, thus achieving \"high-quality\" weight loss.",

          "content": "The premise of this study was to investigate the effect of acute glutamine supplementation on 20\u00a0km time trial cycling performance in the heat, neuromuscular function, inflammation and endotoxemia. Twelve cyclists completed two, 20-km time trials (20TT) in 35\u00a0\u00b0C (50% relative humidity). Participants ingested either glutamine (GLUT; 0.9\u00a0g kg fat-free mass) or a placebo (CON) 60\u00a0min before each 20TT. Physiological and perceptual measures were recorded during each 20TT, and neuromuscular function assessed pre- and post-exercise. Venous blood was analysed for endotoxins, markers of gut damage (inflammatory fatty acid binding protein; I-FABP) and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, IL-6; tumour necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-\u03b1). Data were analysed using linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework. 20TT in the heat increased I-FABP and elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) compared to pre-exercise values but did not result in endotoxemia. Completion time was not statistically different between conditions (mean difference [95% credible interval]\u2009=\u200911\u00a0s [-\u200923, 44]). Relative to CON, GLUT did not alter any physiological or perceptual measures during the 20TT. Glutamine supplementation does not improve 20TT performance in the heat or preserve neuromuscular function when compared to a placebo. These findings suggest that glutamine is not an ergogenic aid or prophylactic intervention for heat-induced gut damage during short-duration self-paced exercise in hot environments.",

          "content": "Although beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine (Arg), and glutamine (Gln) may contribute to wound healing, no prospective studies have investigated the efficacy of a compound consisting of HMB, Arg, and Gln (HMB/Arg/Gln) for reducing wound complications following open abdominal surgery. This study evaluates the usefulness of perioperative nutrition using HMB/Arg/Gln in patients who were scheduled to undergo open surgery for abdominal malignancies in a randomized controlled trial. Patients scheduled for open surgery for abdominal malignancies were randomized to receive HMB/Arg/Gln (1.2 g HMB, 7 g L-Arg, and 7 g L-Gln) or placebo (isocaloric juice). The supplements were provided once daily for 3 days preoperatively and once daily for 7 days postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the incidence of wound complications. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of other complications, postoperative duration of hospital stay, total-body skeletal muscle mass, handgrip strength, and skin water content. Sixty-one patients were randomly assigned to either the HMB/Arg/Gln (n = 31) or the placebo (n = 30) group. One patient in the HMB/Arg/Gln group was ineligible because laparoscopic surgery was performed; thus, 60 patients were analyzed. The incidence of wound complications (20%) was the same in both groups (P = 1.000). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other complications, body composition, handgrip strength, or skin water content between the 2 groups. Serum growth hormone (GH) levels were significantly higher for patients whose total intake was > 80% of planned volume in the HMB/Arg/Gln group. The incidence of wound complications would not be reduced by perioperative HMB/Arg/Gln administration in patients who underwent open surgery. The efficacy of HMB/Arg/Gln for increasing serum GH levels needs to be validated in another large-scale randomized controlled trial.",

          "content": "To examine the dose-response effects of acute glutamine supplementation on markers of gastrointestinal (GI) permeability, damage and, secondary, subjective symptoms of GI discomfort in response to running in the heat. Ten recreationally active males completed a total of four exercise trials; a placebo trial and three glutamine trials at 0.25, 0.5 and 0.9 g\u00a0kg of fat-free mass (FFM) consumed 2\u00a0h before exercise. Each exercise trial consisted of a 60-min treadmill run at 70% of [Formula: see text] in an environmental chamber set at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. GI permeability was measured using ratio of lactulose to rhamnose (L:R) in serum. Plasma glutamine and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) concentrations were determined pre and post exercise. Subjective GI symptoms were assessed 45\u00a0min and 24\u00a0h post-exercise. Relative to placebo, L:R was likely lower following 0.25 g kg (mean difference: -\u00a00.023; \u00b1\u00a00.021) and 0.5 g\u00a0kg (-\u00a00.019; \u00b1\u00a00.019) and very likely following 0.9 g\u00a0kg (-\u00a00.034; \u00b1\u00a00.024). GI symptoms were typically low and there was no effect of supplementation. Acute oral glutamine consumption attenuates GI permeability relative to placebo even at lower doses of 0.25 g\u00a0kg, although larger doses may be more effective. It remains unclear if this will lead to reductions in GI symptoms. Athletes competing in the heat may, therefore, benefit from acute glutamine supplementation prior to exercise in order to maintain gastrointestinal integrity.",

Various nutrients have been shown to be effective in supporting muscular performance. This randomized clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a 2-month administration of food for special medical purposes composed of omega-3 fatty acids (500 mg), leucine (2.5 g), and probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei PS23 (LPPS23), on appendicular lean mass (ALM), muscle performance, inflammatory status, and amino acid profile in sarcopenic patients. A total of 60 participants (aged 79.7 \u00b1 4.8 years and a body mass index of 22.2 \u00b1 2.1 kg/m2) were enrolled and randomly assigned to either intervention (n = 22) or placebo group (n = 28). Comparing the differences in effects between groups (intervention minus placebo effects), ALM increased significantly in the intervention group (p < 0.05), with no discernible change in the placebo group. Similarly, significant differences were also observed for the Tinetti scale (+2.39 points, p < 0.05), the SPPB total score (+2.22 points, p < 0.05), and the handgrip strength (4.09 kg, p < 0.05). Visceral adipose tissue significantly decreased in the intervention group compared to the placebo group at 60 days \u22120.69 g (95% CI: \u22121.09, 0.29) vs. 0.27 g (95% CI: \u22120.11, 0.65), groups difference \u22120.96 (95% CI: \u22121.52, 0.39, p = 0.001). A statistically significant increase in levels of valine, leucine, isoleucine, and total amino acid profiles was observed in the intervention group compared with the placebo group at 60 days (p = 0.001). When taken together, these beneficial effects may be attributed to the innovative composition of this special medical-purpose food which could be considered for the treatment of sarcopenia in the elderly.",

We aimed to study amino acid profile associated with skeletal muscle mass loss longitudinally in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This is a prospective study of 1140 patients aged 56.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.6\u00a0years from the SMART2D cohort. Skeletal muscle mass was measured using bio-impedance analysis at baseline and follow-up. Amino acids were measured by mass spectrometry. Over a period of up to 7.9\u00a0years, 43.9% experienced skeletal muscle mass loss. Lower baseline valine, leucine and isoleucine levels were associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) with corresponding coefficient 0.251(95\u00a0%CI 0.009 to 0.493), 0.298(95\u00a0%CI 0.051 to 0.544)) and 0.366(95\u00a0%CI 0.131 to 0.600). Higher baseline valine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine and tryptophan levels were associated with reduced odds of muscle mass loss with corresponding odds ratio (OR)0.797 (95\u00a0%CI 0.690 to 0.921), 0.825 (95\u00a0%CI 0.713 to 0.955), 0.826 (95\u00a0%CI 0.718-0.950), 0.847 (95\u00a0%CI 0.739-0.969) and 0.835 (95\u00a0%CI 0.720-0.979). The branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine were positively associated with change in SMI and reduced odds of muscle mass loss longitudinally. Further studies should be conducted to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between these amino acids and muscle mass loss in T2DM.",

          "content": "Early prevention of sarcopenia could be an important strategy for muscle retention, but most studies have focused on subjects aged 65 or older. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of leucine-enriched protein supplementation on muscle condition in a sample including late middle-aged adults. A 12-week intervention was performed for 120 healthy community-dwelling adults by providing either leucine-enriched protein supplement [leucine 3 g, protein mixture (casein 50% + whey 40% + soy 10%) 17 g, vitamin D 800IU (20 \u00b5g), calcium 300 mg, fat 1.1 g, carbohydrate 2.5 g] or isocaloric carbohydrate supplement twice per day. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) and lean body mass (LBM) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A total of 111 participants completed the study, with a dropout rate of 9.2%. LBM normalized by height and body weight (LBM/Wt) was significantly increased ( < 0.001) in the intervention group (0 wk: 633.9 \u00b1 8.5 vs. 12 wk 636.9 \u00b1 8.4 in the intervention group; 0 wk: 638.6 \u00b1 8.3 vs. 12 wk: 632.9 \u00b1 8.1 in the control group). In subgroup analyses, significant differences remained only in subjects between 50 and 64 years of age. We concluded that leucine-enriched protein supplementation can have beneficial effects by preventing muscle loss, mainly for late middle-aged adults.",

The objective was to examine the effect of a high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement on muscle mass preservation during intentional weight loss in obese older adults. We included 80 obese older adults in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. During a 13-wk weight loss program, all subjects followed a hypocaloric diet (-600 kcal/d) and performed resistance training 3\u00d7/wk. Subjects were randomly allocated to a high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement including a mix of other macro- and micronutrients (150 kcal, 21 g protein; 10\u00d7/wk, intervention group) or an isocaloric control. The primary outcome was change in appendicular muscle mass. The secondary outcomes were body composition, handgrip strength, and physical performance. Data were analyzed by using ANCOVA and mixed linear models with sex and baseline value as covariates. At baseline, mean \u00b1 SD age was 63 \u00b1 5.6 y, and body mass index (in kg/m(2)) was 33 \u00b1 4.4. During the trial, protein intake was 1.11 \u00b1 0.28 g \u00b7 kg body weight(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) in the intervention group compared with 0.85 \u00b1 0.24 g \u00b7 kg body weight(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) in the control group (P < 0.001). Both intervention and control groups decreased in body weight (-3.4 \u00b1 3.6 kg and -2.8 \u00b1 2.8 kg; both P < 0.001) and fat mass (-3.2 \u00b1 3.1 kg and -2.5 \u00b1 2.4 kg; both P < 0.001), with no differences between groups. The 13-wk change in appendicular muscle mass, however, was different in the intervention and control groups [+0.4 \u00b1 1.2 kg and -0.5 \u00b1 2.1 kg, respectively; \u03b2 = 0.95 kg (95% CI: 0.09, 1.81); P = 0.03]. Muscle strength and function improved over time without significant differences between groups. A high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement compared with isocaloric control preserves appendicular muscle mass in obese older adults during a hypocaloric diet and resistance exercise program and might therefore reduce the risk of sarcopenia. This trial was registered at the Dutch Trial Register (http://www.trialregister.nl) as NTR2751.",

Our goal was to compile data from the available studies in the literature to explore the effect of leucine supplementation on parameters associated with sarcopenia in elderly individuals.  The meta-analysis included older persons over 65 years of age who were recruited on the basis of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People sarcopenia criteria. Studies that were included were those in which at least one sarcopenia criterion was measured, including grip strength, appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height, gait speed, and the short physical performance battery index.  The meta-analysis included ten randomized controlled trials and one prospective study. The leucine group included 566 participants, whereas the placebo group included 567 patients. Patients receiving leucine and patients receiving a placebo had significantly different handgrip ( = 0.03), appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height ( = 0.0.2), and gait speed ( = 0.008). Patients received a high dosage of leucine, and there was a significant difference in the appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height ( = 0.02) and gait speed ( = 0.01) between the high dosage of the leucine group and the control group. When vitamin D was combined with leucine, the appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height ( = 0.03) significantly differed between the leucine group receiving vitamin D and the control group.  Low-quality evidence was found that older sarcopenic patients receiving leucine may show trends toward improved skeletal muscle strength, skeletal muscle quality, and physical performance. The capacity of leucine supplementation to have a beneficial therapeutic impact in older sarcopenic individuals is restricted when it is used alone without concurrent additional therapy.",

To avoid this, resistance training has been proposed as an effective countermeasure, but the additional effect of a protein supplement is not so clear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a whey protein supplement enriched with leucine after resistance training on muscle mass and strength gains in a post-hospitalized elderly population. A total of 28 participants were included and allocated to either protein supplementation or placebo supplementation following resistance training for 12 weeks (2 days/week). Physical function (lower and upper body strength, aerobic capacity and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test), mini nutritional assessment (MNA) and body composition (Dual X-ray Absorptiometry) were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of resistance training. Both groups showed improvements in physical function after the intervention ( < 0.01), but there were no further effects for the protein group ( > 0.05). Muscle mass did not improve after resistance training in either group ( > 0.05). In conclusion, 12 weeks of resistance training are enough to improve physical function in a post-hospitalized elderly population with no further benefits for the protein-supplemented group.",

An amino acid database was established using the 9th revision of the Korean Standard Food Composition Table. The mean handgrip strength was estimated from triplicate measurements obtained using the dominant hand. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between BCAA intake and handgrip strength. Grains greatly contributed to amino acid intake; however, a significant negative association was observed between handgrip strength and increased BCAA intake through grains. In the fully adjusted model, leucine intake and handgrip strength showed a positive association.

A randomized controlled trial. A community in Hyogo, Japan. The study included older adults aged \u2265 65 years who were screened for sarcopenia at the Care Center from, a community in Hyogo, Japan. The participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: whey protein supplementation after resistance training (RT + PRO; n = 27), resistance training only (RT; n = 27), and whey protein supplementation only (PRO; n = 27). An intervention program was conducted over a period of 24 weeks. The program included RT and/or PRO supplementation twice a week for 24 weeks, followed by a de-training period for another 24 weeks. PRO supplementation included 11.0 g of protein and 2,300 mg of leucine. The total energy and protein intake amounts for the participants in all groups were controlled to achieve at least 30 kcal/kg ideal body weight (IBW)/day and 1.2 g/kg IBW/day, respectively, during the intervention and de-training periods. The primary outcomes, such as mean change of appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (\u0394ASMI), and secondary outcomes, such as handgrip strength (\u0394HGS), were measured at baseline, the end of intervention, and at 12 and 24 weeks of de-training. Compared to baseline, ASMI and HGS increased significantly at the end of the intervention period in the RT+PRO group (ASMI and HGS, p < 0.01); however, there were no significant differences in \u0394ASMI and \u0394HGS between each group. At 24 weeks of the de-training period, \u0394ASMI and \u0394HGS were higher in the RT + PRO group than in the RT group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). We demonstrated that combined intervention of RT and PRO showed long-term maintenance in treating sarcopenia than RT only at 24 weeks after de-training. Therefore, PRO intake after RT may be useful in the treatment of sarcopenia in older adults.",

          "content": "The effects of dietary supplementation with the leucine metabolite beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) were studied in two experiments. In study 1, subjects (n = 41) were randomized among three levels of HMB supplementation (0, 1.5 or 3.0 g HMB/day) and two protein levels (normal, 117 g/day, or high, 175 g/day) and weight lifted for 1.5 h 3 days/wk for 3 wk. In study 2, subjects (n = 28) were fed either 0 or 3.0 g HMB/day and weight lifted for 2-3 h 6 days/wk for 7 wk. In study 1, HMB significantly decreased the exercise-induced rise in muscle proteolysis as measured by urine 3-methylhistidine during the first 2 wk of exercise (linear decrease, P < 0.04). Plasma creatine phosphokinase was also decreased with HMB supplementation (week 3, linear decrease, P < 0.05). Weight lifted was increased by HMB supplementation when compared with the unsupplemented subjects during each week of the study (linear increase, P < 0.02). In study 2, fat-free mass was significantly increased in HMB-supplemented subjects compared with the unsupplemented group at 2 and 4-6 wk of the study (P < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation with either 1.5 or 3 g HMB/day can partly prevent exercise-induced proteolysis and/or muscle damage and result in larger gains in muscle function associated with resistance training.",

Outcomes investigated were: total body mass (TBM), FFM, fat mass (FM), total single repetition maximum (1RM), bench press (BP) 1RM, and lower body (LwB) 1RM. Databases consulted were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (Embase), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SportDiscus. Fourteen studies fit the inclusion criteria; however, 11 were analyzed after data extraction and funnel plot analysis exclusion. A total of 302 participants (18-45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 248 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes. We conclude that HMB produces a small effect on TBM gain, but this effect does not translate into significantly greater increases in FFM, strength or decreases in FM during periods of RET. Our findings do not support the use of HMB aiming at improvement of body composition or strength with RET.",

          "content": "Malnutrition and metabolic alterations of cancer cachexia are often associated with negative weight loss and muscle mass wasting. In this sense, protein supplementation can be a strategy to help counteract the loss and/or maintenance of mass in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of leucine supplementation on body composition in outpatients with gastrointestinal tract cancer. It was a randomized, blinded, controlled, parallel trial, performed in male patients with a cancer diagnosis of the gastrointestinal tract and appendix organs undergoing chemotherapy. All the patients were allocated to one of the protocol groups: L-leucine supplement or the control group, during 8 weeks of intervention. We evaluated the body composition through bioelectrical impedance analysis, the cancer cachexia classification, and the diet intake before and after the intervention protocol. The intention-to-treat approach was performed to predict the missing values for all patients who provide any observation data. The patients were an average age of 65.11 \u00b1 7.50 years old. In the body composition analysis with patients who finished all the supplementation, we observed a significant gain in body weight (61.79.9 \u00b1 9.02 versus 64.06 \u00b1 9.45,  = 0.01), ASMM (7.64 \u00b1 1.24 versus 7.81 \u00b1 1.20,  = 0.02) in the Leucine group, whereas patients in the control did not present significant variation in these parameters. There was no significant intergroup difference. While in the analysis included the patients with intention-to-treat, we found a significant increase in body weight ( = 0.01), BMI ( = 0.01), FFM ( = 0.03), and ASMM ( = 0.01) in the Leucine group. No significant intergroup differences. These results also similar among cachectic patients. A balanced diet enriched with free-Leucine supplementation was able to promotes gains in body weight and lean mass in older men diagnosticated with gastrointestinal and appendix organs of digestion cancer after 8 weeks. However, the fact that most men are non-cachectic or pre-cachectic is not clear if the increase in muscle mass was due to a high intake of leucine, since no difference between groups was detected. Moreover, we know that benefits on body composition are due to adequate calorie and macronutrients consumption and that balanced feeding according to nutrition Guidelines seems crucial and must be advised during the oncological treatment.",

J Strength Cond Res 38(3): 526-532, 2024-This study examined the effects of supplementing 5 g of leucine compared with a placebo during a 10-week resistance training program on body composition parameters and adipokine concentrations in untrained, perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Thirty-five women were randomly assigned to 2 groups-leucine (LEU, n = 17) and placebo (PLC, n = 18)-in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Each group consumed the supplement or placebo every day and completed a resistance training program for 10 weeks. Using 3-day food records, a diet was assessed before the intervention and after its cessation. Body composition was assessed preintervention and postintervention using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Moreover, the concentrations of adipokines, such as adiponectin, visfatin, leptin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), were assessed preintervention and postintervention. Both groups showed an increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area ( p = 0.030) and fat-free mass (FFM; p = 0.023). There were significant group differences in concentrations of visfatin ( p = 0.020) and leptin ( p = 0.038) between the PLC and LEU groups. Visfatin displayed higher concentrations in the PLC group and leptin displayed higher concentrations in the LEU group. In addition, there were significant decreases in adiponectin concentrations for both groups (LEU: 652 \u00b1 513 to 292 \u00b1 447 pg\u00b7ml -1 ; PLC: 584 \u00b1 572 to 245 \u00b1 356 pg\u00b7ml -1 , p = 0.002) and MCP-1 only decreased in the PLC group (253 \u00b1 119 to 206 \u00b1 106 pg\u00b7ml -1 , p = 0.004). There were significant decreases in adiponectin concentrations in both groups and a decrease in MCP-1 concentrations in the PLC group. These decreases may be due to both adipokines possible relationship with VAT area. However, it is not known whether leucine has underlying properties that hinder changes in MCP-1 concentrations.",

Betaine supplementation failed to significantly affect BM ((weighted mean difference (WMD): -0\u00b740 kg, 95 % CI -1\u00b746, 0\u00b764),  = 0\u00b7447), BMI ((WMD: -0\u00b705 kg/m, 95 % CI -0\u00b736, 0\u00b725),  = 0\u00b7719), BFP ((WMD: 0\u00b726 %, 95 % CI -0\u00b782, 1\u00b736),  = 0\u00b7663), FM ((WMD: -0\u00b757 kg, 95 % CI -2\u00b714, 0\u00b799),  = 0\u00b7473) and FFM ((WMD: 0\u00b761 kg, 95 % CI -1\u00b727, 2\u00b749),  = 0\u00b7527). Subgroup analyses based on participant's age (< 40 and > 40 years), sex, BMI, trial duration (< 8 and \u2265 8 weeks), betaine supplementation dosage (< 4 and \u2265 4 g) and health status (healthy or unhealthy) demonstrated similar results. Other than a potential negligible increase in protein intake (WMD: 3\u00b756 g, 95 % CI 0\u00b724, 6\u00b788,  = 0\u00b7035), no changes in dietary intakes were observed following betaine supplementation compared with control. The present systematic review and meta-analysis does not show any beneficial effects of betaine supplementation on body composition indices (BM, BMI, FM and FFM).",

Our study assessed the association of circulating betaine with lean mass and its composition in Chinese adults. A community-based study was conducted on 1996 Guangzhou residents (weight/mass: 1381/615) aged 50-75 years between 2008 and 2010. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect general baseline information. Fasting serum betaine was assessed using HPLC-MS. A total of 1590 participants completed the body composition analysis performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry during a mean of 3\u00b72 years of follow-up. After adjustment for age, regression analyses demonstrated a positive association of serum betaine with percentage of lean mass (LM%) of the entire body, trunk and limbs in men (all P<0\u00b705) and LM% of the trunk in women (P=0\u00b7016). Each sd increase in serum betaine was associated with increases in LM% of 0\u00b7609 (whole body), 0\u00b7811 (trunk), 0\u00b7422 (limbs), 0\u00b7632 (arms) and 0\u00b7346 (legs) in men and 0\u00b7350 (trunk) in women. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the prevalence of lower LM% decreased by 17 % (whole body) and 14 % (trunk) in women and 23 % (whole body), 28 % (trunk), 22 % (arms) and 26 % (percentage skeletal muscle index) in men with each sd increment in serum betaine. Elevated circulating betaine was associated with a higher LM% and lower prevalence of lower LM% in middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults, particularly men.",

          "content": "Previous studies suggest that betaine and choline may be beneficial for body composition. However, no longitudinal study has been conducted to illustrate if choline and betaine have long-term effects on changes in body composition. This study aimed to prospectively investigate the association between serum choline and betaine concentrations and 3-year changes in body composition in community-dwelling Chinese adults. This present analysis used data from 1384 women and 554 men aged 40-75 years. Serum concentrations of betaine and choline at baseline were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Body composition parameters, i.e., muscle mass (MM), fat mass (FM), and body fat percentage (FM%) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the first and the second follow-ups. After adjustment for potential cofounders, higher serum choline concentrations were associated with a lower decrease in MM in men (\u03b2 = 0.022,  = 0.025) and a lower increase in FM and FM% in women with baseline choline concentrations below 21.5 \u03bcmol/L (all  for nonlinearity = 0.007); higher serum betaine concentrations were associated with a lower decline in MM and a lower increase in FM and FM% among men whose betaine concentrations were lower than 55 \u03bcmol/L (all  for nonlinearity < 0.05). These findings suggest that higher concentrations of serum choline and betaine may be associated with favorable changes in body composition profiles among men and women who have relatively low concentrations, especially in men.  Higher concentrations of serum choline and betaine were associated with favorable changes in body composition. Such favorable associations were more pronounced in men.",

          "content": "There is conflicting evidence on the relationship between dietary choline and betaine with metabolic markers and anthropometric characteristics. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the interaction effects of dietary choline and betaine and physical activity (PA) on circulating creatine kinase (CK), metabolic and glycemic markers, and anthropometric characteristics in active youth. In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 120 to 18 to 35-year-old people. The food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary data; United States Department of Agriculture website was used to calculate choline and betaine in foods. CK, fasting blood sugar (FBS) and lipid profile markers were measured with ELISA kits. Low-density lipoprotein, and insulin sensitivity markers were calculated. Sociodemographic status, physical activity, and anthropometric characteristics were assessed based on a valid and reliable method. Analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) tests adjusted for sex, PA, age, energy, and body mass index were used. Increasing dietary betaine and total choline and betaine was positively related to weight, waist-to-hip ratio, fat-free mass and bone mass (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Increasing dietary betaine lowered total cholesterol (P\u2009=\u20090.032) and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) (P\u2009=\u20090.049). The interaction effect of dietary choline and physical activity improved insulin resistance (P\u2009<\u20090.05). As well as dietary betaine interacted with physical activity increased HDL (P\u2009=\u20090.049). In addition, dietary total choline and betaine interacted with physical activity decreased FBS (P\u2009=\u20090.047). In general, increasing dietary choline and betaine along with moderate and high physical activity improved insulin resistance, increased HDL, and lowered FBS in the higher tertiles of dietary choline and betaine.",

This study investigated the effects of BET supplementation on markers of metabolic flexibility, body composition, and anaerobic performance in college females. Twenty-three active subjects with 21.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0\u2009years of age, 66.6\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8\u2009kg body mass, 1.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009m height, and 23.2\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3% body fat performed a graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer consisting of 4 incremental, 3\u2009min stages for collection of fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates. Three 10\u2009s sprint tests were then completed against a resistance of 7.5% of body mass, separated by 2.5\u2009min of recovery. The study comprised 3 phases: (a) pre-supplementation, (b) randomization to supplement for 2-weeks with either 2.4\u2009g/day BET or placebo (parallel design), and (c) post-supplementation. Repeated-measures analysis of variance were conducted to determine interactions or main effects. There were no group differences for substrate oxidation rates (\u2009>\u20090.05). Although body composition improved pre-post for both groups (\u2009<\u20090.05), only the BET group experienced a significant increase in fat free mass (\u2009<\u20090.01; \u223c3%). Further, only the BET group experienced improvements to performance such as a higher mean power output during the final sprint (\u2009=\u20090.02; \u223c3%) and a lower RPE during the final stage of the graded exercise test (\u2009=\u20090.02).

          "content": "Betaine supplementation has been shown to improve body composition and some metrics of muscular performance in young men; but, whether betaine enhances body composition or performance in female subjects is currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between resistance training adaptation and chronic betaine supplementation in females. Twenty-three young women (21.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u00a0years, 165.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u00a0cm, 68.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8\u00a0kg) without prior structured resistance training experience volunteered for this study. Body composition (BodPod), rectus femoris muscle thickness (B-mode Ultrasound), vertical jump, back squat 1RM and bench press 1RM were assessed pre- and post-training. Following 1\u00a0week of familiarization training, subjects were matched for body composition and squat strength, and randomly assigned to either a betaine (2.5\u00a0g/day; n\u2009=\u200911) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200912) group that completed 3 sets of 6-7 exercises per day performed to momentary muscular failure. Training was divided into two lower and one upper body training sessions per week performed on non-consecutive days for 8\u00a0weeks, and weekly volume load was used to analyze work capacity. Significant main effects of time were found for changes in lean mass (2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u00a0kg), muscle thickness (0.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u00a0cm), vertical jump (1.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u00a0cm), squat 1RM (39.8\u2009\u00b1\u200914.0\u00a0kg), and bench press 1 RM (9.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\u00a0kg); however, there were no significant interactions. A trend (p\u2009=\u2009.056) was found for greater weekly training volumes for betaine versus placebo. Significant interactions were found for changes in body fat percentage and fat mass: body fat percentage and fat mass decreased significantly more in betaine (-\u20093.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7%; -\u20092.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u00a0kg) compared to placebo (-\u20091.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6%; -\u20090.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u00a0kg), respectively.

There are numerous studies with inconsistent results that evaluated the association between dietary choline intakes with cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between dietary betaine and choline intakes with cardio-metabolic risk factors is not well studied. In the current study, our aim was to evaluate dietary choline and betaine intakes in the usual diet of obese individuals and to assess its association with serum lipids, blood pressure and glycemic markers among obese individuals. We recruited a total number of 359 obese people aged between 20 and 50 years in the present study. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used for dietary assessment; dietary choline and betaine intakes were calculated using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) database. National cholesterol education program adult treatment panel (NCEP-ATP)-III criteria was used metabolic syndrome (MetS) definition. Enzymatic methods were used to assess biochemical variables. Body composition was measured with the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method. Higher body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), fat-free mass (FFM) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were observed in higher tertiles of dietary choline intake (P\u2009<\u20090.01). There was no significant difference in terms of biochemical parameters among different tertiles of dietary choline intake, while systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were reduced in higher betaine tertiles (P\u2009<\u20090.05). For total dietary choline and betaine intakes, there was a reduction in DBP and low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Also, a non-significant reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and MetS prevalence was observed in higher tertiles of dietary choline and betaine intakes. After classification of the study population according to MetS status, there was no significant difference in biochemical variables in subjects with MetS (P\u2009>\u20090.05), while in the non-MetS group, SBP, DBP, TG and insulin levels reduced in higher tertiles of dietary betaine and choline (P\u2009>\u20090.05). According to our findings, higher dietary intakes of choline and betaine were associated with lower levels of blood pressure and LDL concentrations among obese individuals.

          "content": "Tribulus terrestris is an herbal nutritional supplement that is promoted to produce large gains in strength and lean muscle mass in 5-28 days (15, 18). Although some manufacturers claim T. terrestris will not lead to a positive drug test, others have suggested that T. terrestris may increase the urinary testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) ratio, which may place athletes at risk of a positive drug test. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of T. terrestris on strength, fat free mass, and the urinary T/E ratio during 5 weeks of preseason training in elite rugby league players. Twenty-two Australian elite male rugby league players (mean +/- SD; age = 19.8 +/- 2.9 years; weight = 88.0 +/- 9.5 kg) were match-paired and randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to either a T. terrestris (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11) group. All subjects performed structured heavy resistance training as part of the club's preseason preparations. A T. terrestris extract (450 mg.d(-1)) or placebo capsules were consumed once daily for 5 weeks. Muscular strength, body composition, and the urinary T/E ratio were monitored prior to and after supplementation. After 5 weeks of training, strength and fat free mass increased significantly without any between-group differences. No between-group differences were noted in the urinary T/E ratio. It was concluded that T. terrestris did not produce the large gains in strength or lean muscle mass that many manufacturers claim can be experienced within 5-28 days. Furthermore, T. terrestris did not alter the urinary T/E ratio and would not place an athlete at risk of testing positive based on the World Anti-Doping Agency's urinary T/E ratio limit of 4:1.",

          "content": "Several supplements are purported to promote muscle hypertrophy and strength gains in healthy subjects, or to prevent muscle wasting in atrophying situations (e.g., ageing or disuse periods). However, their effectiveness remains unclear. This review summarizes the available evidence on the beneficial impacts of several popular supplements on muscle mass or strength. Among the supplements tested, nitrate and caffeine returned sufficient evidence supporting their acute beneficial effects on muscle strength, whereas the long-term consumption of creatine, protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids seems to consistently increase or preserve muscle mass and strength (evidence level A). On the other hand, mixed or unclear evidence was found for several popular supplements including branched-chain amino acids, adenosine triphosphate, citrulline, \u03b2-Hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate, minerals, most vitamins, phosphatidic acid or arginine (evidence level B), weak or scarce evidence was found for conjugated linoleic acid, glutamine, resveratrol, tribulus terrestris or ursolic acid (evidence level C), and no evidence was found for other supplements such as ornithine or \u03b1-ketoglutarate (evidence D). Of note, although most supplements appear to be safe when consumed at typical doses, some adverse events have been reported for some of them (e.g., caffeine, vitamins, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, tribulus terrestris, arginine) after large intakes, and there is insufficient evidence to determine the safety of many frequently used supplements (e.g., ornithine, conjugated linoleic acid, ursolic acid). In summary, despite their popularity, there is little evidence supporting the use of most supplements, and some of them have been even proven ineffective or potentially associated with adverse effects.",

Consecutive HCV-infected patients after treatment with DAA were recruited into the study. Patients who achieved sustained virological response (SVR); and had complete clinical information, preserved serum samples at baseline and SVR48, and skeletal muscle mass evaluations based on the psoas muscle mass index (PMI) on computed tomography at baseline and\u2009\u2265\u200912\u00a0months were included. Altogether, 70.7% of patients (41/58) showed increased PMI after DAA therapy, and mean relative PMI was significantly higher after DAA therapy than at baseline. There were no significant associations between baseline clinical factors routinely examined in clinical practice and increased PMI. Among factors reported to be associated with skeletal muscle loss in patients with chronic liver disease, serum zinc levels and total and free carnitine levels increased significantly after DAA therapy and only changes in serum free carnitine levels were significantly associated with an increased PMI (r\u2009=\u20090305, P\u2009=\u20090.020). In conclusion, increased skeletal muscle mass after successful HCV eradication by DAAs was significantly associated with increased serum-free carnitine levels.

A 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted. Fibromyalgia patients were randomly assigned to receive either creatine monohydrate or placebo in a double-blind manner. The patients were evaluated at baseline and after 16 weeks. Muscle function, aerobic conditioning, cognitive function, quality of sleep, quality of life, kidney function, and adverse events were assessed. Muscle phosphorylcreatine content was measured through (31) P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After the intervention, the creatine group presented higher muscle phosphorylcreatine content when compared with the placebo group (+80.3% versus -2.7%; P = 0.04). Furthermore, the creatine group presented greater muscle strength than the placebo group in the leg press and chest press exercises (+9.8% and +1.2% for creatine versus -0.5% and -7.2% for placebo, respectively; P = 0.02 and P = 0.002, respectively). Isometric strength was greater in the creatine group than in the placebo group (+6.4% versus -3.2%; P = 0.007). However, no general changes were observed in aerobic conditioning, pain, cognitive function, quality of sleep, and quality of life. Food intake remained unaltered and no side effects were reported. Creatine supplementation increased intramuscular phosphorylcreatine content and improved lower- and upper-body muscle function, with minor changes in other fibromyalgia features. These findings introduce creatine supplementation as a useful dietary intervention to improve muscle function in fibromyalgia patients.",

          "content": "Creatine is a supplement used by sportsmen to increase athletic performance by improving energy supply to muscle tissues. It is also an essential brain compound and some hypothesize that it aids cognition by improving energy supply and neuroprotection. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of oral creatine administration on cognitive function in healthy individuals. A search of multiple electronic databases was performed for the identification of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the cognitive effects of oral creatine supplementation in healthy individuals. Six studies (281 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Generally, there was evidence that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration. Regarding other cognitive domains, such as long-term memory, spatial memory, memory scanning, attention, executive function, response inhibition, word fluency, reaction time and mental fatigue, the results were conflicting. Performance on cognitive tasks stayed unchanged in young individuals. Vegetarians responded better than meat-eaters in memory tasks but for other cognitive domains no differences were observed. Oral creatine administration may improve short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning of healthy individuals but its effect on other cognitive domains remains unclear. Findings suggest potential benefit for aging and stressed individuals. Since creatine is safe, future studies should include larger sample sizes. It is imperative that creatine should be tested on patients with dementias or cognitive impairment.",

          "content": "The role of creatine supplementation in young athletes and bodybuilders is well established including ergogenic properties of muscular hypertrophy, strength, power, and endurance. Whether the benefits of creatine supplementation translate to an aging population with moderate training stimulus remains unclear especially in regard to gender, creatine dose, and duration. This systematic review assessed whether creatine supplementation combined with exercise results in additive improvements in indices of skeletal muscle, bone, and mental health over exercise alone in healthy older adults. PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were utilized to identify randomized controlled trials of creatine supplementation combined with exercise in an aging population with additional predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, and performed quality assessments using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Seventeen studies were comprehensively reviewed according to categories of strength, endurance, functional capacity, body composition, cognition, and safety. These studies suggest that any additive ergogenic creatine effects on upper and/or lower body strength, functional capacity, and lean mass in an older population would require a continuous and daily low-dose creatine supplementation combined with at least 12 weeks of resistance training. Potential creatine specific increases in regional bone mineral density of the femur are possible but may require at least 1 year of creatine supplementation combined with moderate resistance training, and additional long-term clinical trials are warranted. The limited data suggested no additive effects of creatine over exercise alone on indices of mental health. The beneficial effects of creatine supplementation are more consistent in older women than in men. Creatine monohydrate is safe to use in older adults. While creatine in conjunction with moderate- to high-intensity exercise in an aging population may improve skeletal muscle health, additional studies are needed to determine the effective dosing and duration paradigm for potential combined creatine and exercise effects on bone and cognition in older adults.",

Co-ingestion of creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation did not increase measures of maximal strength compared to creatine alone. The effects of creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation on body composition were equivocal, with one study reporting greater lean mass gains and fat mass reductions compared to creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation individually, while another found no significant improvements. Additionally, no significant improvements in aerobic endurance capacity (VOmax, lactate threshold, or time to exhaustion) were observed from creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation co-ingestion. : The combination of creatine and \u03b2-alanine supplementation may be effective for enhancing high-intensity exercise performance but has no greater effect on maximal strength, body composition, or measures of aerobic capacity compared to creatine or \u03b2-alanine alone.",

          "content": "This study aimed to compare the effects of an 8-week creatine (CR) or placebo (PL) supplementation on muscle strength, thickness, endurance, and body composition employing different training paradigms with blood flow restriction (BFR) vs. traditional resistance training (TRAD). Seventeen healthy males were randomized between the PL (\u00a0=\u00a09) and CR (\u00a0=\u00a08) groups. Participants were trained unilaterally utilizing a within-between subject bicep curl exercise where each arm was allocated to TRAD or BFR for 8 weeks. Muscular strength, thickness, endurance, and body composition were evaluated. Creatine supplementation promoted increases in muscle thickness in TRAD and BFR compared with their placebo counterparts, however, without a significant difference between treatments (\u00a0=\u00a00.349). TRAD training increased maximum strength (1 repetition maximum (1RM)) compared with BFR after 8 weeks of training (\u00a0=\u00a00.021). Repetitions to failure at 30% of 1RM were increased in the BFR-CR group compared with the TRAD-CR group (\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Repetitions to failure at 70% 1RM were increased from weeks 0-4 (\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 4-8 (\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in all groups. Creatine supplementation exerted a hypertrophic effect when utilized with TRAD and BFR paradigms and increased muscle performance at 30% 1RM when utilized in conjunction with BFR. Therefore, creatine supplementation seems to amplify muscle adaptation following a BFR program.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a creatine and electrolyte formulated multi-ingredient performance supplement (MIPS) on strength and power performance compared to a placebo. Maximal strength along with total concentric work, mean rate of force development (mRFD), mean power, peak power, and peak force for both bench press and back squat were determined at pre-test and post-test separated by 6 weeks of supplementation. Twenty-two subjects (6 females, 21\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009yrs., 72.46\u2009\u00b1\u200911.18\u2009kg, 1.72\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u2009m) performed a one-repetition maximum (1RM) for back squat and bench press. Eighty percent of the subject's pre-test 1RM was used for a maximal repetition test to assess performance variables. Testing was separated by 6 weeks of supplementation of a MIPS dose per day in a double-blind fashion for comparison. A two-way mixed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied with an alpha level of 0.05. For their back squat 1RM, the MIPS group displayed significant increase of 13.4% (95% CI: 2.77, 23.8%) while placebo displayed a decrease of -\u20090.2% (95% CI: -\u20091.46, 2.87%) (p\u2009=\u20090.047, \u03b7\u2009=\u20090.201). The MIPS displayed a significant increase of 5.9% (95% CI: 2.5, 10.1%) and placebo displayed a non-significant increase of 0.7% (95% CI: -\u20093.49, 3.9%) in bench press maximal strength (p\u2009=\u20090.033,0.217).

          "content": "While creatine has been known to man since 1835, when a French scientist reported finding this constitutent of meat, its presence in athletics as a performance enhancer is relatively new. Amid claims of increased power and strength, decreased performance time and increased muscle mass, creatine is being hailed as a true ergogenic aid. Creatinine is synthesised from the amino acids glycine, arginine and methionine in the kidneys, liver and pancreas, and is predominantly found in skeletal muscle, where it exists in 2 forms. Approximately 40% is in the free creatine form (Crfree), while the remaining 60% is in the phosphorylated form, creatine phosphate (CP). The daily turnover rate of approximately 2 g per day is equally met via exogenous intake and endogenous synthesis. Although creatine concentration (Cr) is greater in fast twitch muscle fibres, slow twitch fibres have a greater resynthesis capability due to their increased aerobic capacity. There appears to be no significant difference between males and females in Cr, and training does not appear to effect Cr. The 4 roles in which creatine is involved during performance are temporal energy buffering, spatial energy buffering, proton buffering and glycolysis regulation. Creatine supplementation of 20 g per day for at least 3 days has resulted in significant increases in total Cr for some individuals but not others, suggesting that there are 'responders' and 'nonresponders'. These increases in total concentration among responders is greatest in individuals who have the lowest initial total Cr, such as vegetarians. Increased concentrations of both Crfree and CP are believed to aid performance by providing more short term energy, as well as increase the rate of resynthesis during rest intervals. Creatine supplementation does not appear to aid endurance and incremental type exercises, and may even be detrimental. Studies investigating the effects of creatine supplementation on short term, high intensity exercises have reported equivocal results, with approximately equal numbers reporting significant and nonsignificant results. The only side effect associated with creatine supplementation appears to be a small increase in body mass, which is due to either water retention or increased protein synthesis.",

Fifteen healthy young men performed 90 min of bicycle exercise for 3 consecutive days.

Blood samples were obtained 22 times during the experimental period. Endurance exercise significantly elevated serum CK from 3 h after the first exercise session (P < 0.05) and gradually increased thereafter. Subjects were classified into two groups according to their peak CK values: high responders (HR; >500 IU/l of CK) and low responders (LR; <300 IU/l of CK). Peak CK values during the experimental period correlated (P < 0.01) with workload/cross-sectional area of the QFM (r = 0.658), workload/volume of the QFM (r = 0.648), and knee extensor strength/body mass (r = -0.634); however, the HR and LR groups were separated in each variable. Thus the break point of CK release after endurance exercise under these conditions is 300-500 IU/l, two or three times higher than in the resting condition, and is associated with properties of the QFM.",

          "content": "The importance of the brain in sports was recently confirmed by the negative effect of mental fatigue (MF) on sport-specific psychomotor skills. Creatine supplementation improves strength but can also improve cognitive functioning. To explore the role of creatine in combating MF, we evaluated whether creatine supplementation counteracts the MF-associated impairment in sport-specific psychomotor skills. In 23\u00b0C, 14 healthy participants (4 females, 10 males; mean \u00b1 SD, age = 24 \u00b1 3 yr, mass = 74 \u00b1 13 kg, height = 179 \u00b1 9 cm) performed a 90-min mentally fatiguing task (counterbalanced, crossover, and double-blinded; i.e., Stroop task) in two different conditions: after a 7-d creatine supplementation (CR; 20 g\u00b7d) and after a 7-d calcium lactate supplementation (placebo [PLAC]), separated by a 5-wk washout. In both conditions, a 7-min sport-specific visuomotor task, a dynamic handgrip strength endurance task, and a 3-min Flanker task was performed before and after the mentally fatiguing task. Physiological and perceptual responses were measured throughout the protocol. Handgrip strength endurance was higher in CR compared with PLAC (P = 0.022). MF impaired visuomotor response time (+4.4%; P = 0.022) and Flanker accuracy (-5.0%; P = 0.009) in both conditions. Accuracy on the Stroop task was higher in CR compared with PLAC (+4.9%; P = 0.026). Within the perceptual and physiological parameters, only motivation and vigor (P \u2264 0.027) were lower in CR compared with PLAC. Creatine supplementation improved physical (strength endurance) and prolonged cognitive (Stroop accuracy) performance, yet it did not combat MF-induced impairments in short sport-specific psychomotor or cognitive (Flanker) performance. These results warrant further investigation in the potential role of creatine in combating the MF-associated decrements in prolonged (e.g., 90-min soccer game) sport performance and suggest a role of brain phosphocreatine in MF.",

          "content": "effect of oral creatine supplementation (CR; 5 g/day) in conjunction with exercise training on physical fitness was investigated in men between 55 and 75 yr of age (n = 46). A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled (PL) trial was performed over a 6-mo period. Furthermore, a subgroup (n = 20) completed a 1-yr follow-up. The training program consisted of cardiorespiratory endurance training as well as moderate resistance training (2-3 sessions/wk). Endurance capacity was evaluated during a maximal incremental bicycle ergometer test, maximal isometric strength of the knee-extensor muscles was assessed by an isokinetic dynamometer, and body composition was assessed by hydrostatic weighing. Furthermore, in a subgroup (PL: n = 13; CR: n = 12) biopsies were taken from m. vastus lateralis to determine total creatine (TCr) content. In PL, 6 mo of training increased peak oxygen uptake rate (+16%; P < 0.05). Fat-free mass slightly increased (+0.3 kg; P < 0.05), whereas percent body fat slightly decreased (-1.2%; P < 0.05). The training intervention did not significantly change either maximal isometric strength or body weight. The responses were independent of CR. Still, compared with PL, TCr was increased by approximately 5% in CR, and this increase was closely correlated with initial muscle creatine content (r = -0.78; P < 0.05). After a 1-yr follow-up, muscle TCr was not higher in CR than in PL. Furthermore, the other measurements were not affected by CR. It is concluded that long-term creatine intake (5 g/day) in conjunction with exercise training does not beneficially impact physical fitness in men between 55 and 75 yr of age.",

Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of creatine on muscle function and metabolism, aerobic capacity, fatigue, physical activity, and quality of life (QOL), as well as its safety. We conducted a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, multiple-baseline design; patients were assigned to creatine or placebo. Feasibility was assessed using attended study visits, completed study procedures, and adherence. Muscle function, aerobic capacity, and muscle strength were assessed with standardized exercise tests. Muscle metabolism was assessed using a 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy protocol. Fatigue, physical activity, and QOL were assessed by questionnaires. Statistical significance was estimated using a randomization (permutation) test. Changes in outcome measures taken at baseline and end-of-study were calculated using paired -tests. Median (range) adherence to the study drug was 88.5% (20.5-95.5%) and the proportion of subjects with 80% adherence or higher was 76.9%. There were no missed study visits. There were no statistically significant changes in muscle function, strength, aerobic capacity, disease activity, fatigue, physical activity, or QOL while subjects were receiving creatine compared to placebo. There were statistically significant adaptations in muscle metabolism (e.g., decrease in change in muscle pH following exercise, and decrease in phosphate/phosphocreatine ratio) at the end-of-study compared to baseline. There were no significant adverse effects. Creatine supplementation in children with JDM is feasible to study, and is safe and well-tolerated; it may lead to improvements in muscle metabolism.",

          "content": "Muscle mass is important for metastatic prostate cancer survival and quality of life (QoL). The backbone of treatment for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with an androgen signaling inhibitor. ADT is an effective cancer treatment, but it facilitates significant declines in muscle mass and adverse health outcomes important to mCSPC survivors, such as fatigue, and reductions in physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, and QoL. In non-metastatic CSPC survivors, resistance training (RT) preserves muscle mass and improves these related health outcomes, but the biggest barrier to RT in CSPC survivors of all stages is fatigue. Creatine monohydrate supplementation coupled with RT (Cr\u2009+\u2009RT) may address this barrier since creatine plays a critical role in energy metabolism. Cr\u2009+\u2009RT in cancer-free older adults and other clinical populations improves muscle mass and related health outcomes. Evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation can complement cancer treatment. Thus, Cr\u2009+\u2009RT is a strategy that addresses gaps in survivorship needs of people with mCSPC. The purpose of this parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial is to test the effects of 52-weeks of Cr\u2009+\u2009RT compared with placebo (PLA) and RT (PLA\u2009+\u2009RT) on muscle mass, other related health outcomes, and markers of cancer progression. We will carry out this trial with our team's established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program in 200 mCSPC survivors receiving ADT, and evaluate outcomes at baseline, 24-, and 52-weeks. RT will occur twice weekly with elastic resistance bands, and an established creatine supplementation protocol will be used for supplementation delivery. Our approach addresses a major facilitator to RT in mCSPC survivors, a home-based RT program, while utilizing a supervised model for safety. Findings will improve delivery of comprehensive survivorship care by providing a multicomponent, patient-centered lifestyle strategy to preserve muscle mass, improve health outcomes, and complement cancer treatment (NCT06112990).",

          "content": "There is robust evidence that creatine monohydrate supplementation can enhance short-term high-intensity exercise in athletes. However, the effect of creatine monohydrate supplementation on aerobic performance and its role during aerobic activities is still controversial. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the supplementation effects of creatine monohydrate on endurance performance in a trained population. The search strategy in this systematic review and meta-analysis was designed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were explored from inception until 19 May, 2022. Only human experimental trials, controlled with a placebo group, evaluating the effects of creatine monohydrate supplementation on endurance performance in a trained population were analyzed in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. A total of 13 studies satisfied all the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The results for the pooled meta-analysis showed a non-significant change in endurance performance after creatine monohydrate supplementation in a trained population (p\u2009=\u20090.47), with a trivial negative effect (pooled standardized mean difference\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.07 [95% confidence interval\u2009-\u20090.32 to 0.18]; I\u2009=\u200934.75%). Further, after excluding the studies not evenly distributed around the base of the funnel plot, the results were similar (pooled standardized mean difference\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.07 [95% confidence interval\u2009-\u20090.27 to 0.13]; I\u2009=\u20090%; p\u2009=\u20090.49).

          "content": "Creatine supplementation has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological therapeutic strategy to counteract muscle dysfunction and low lean mass in a variety of conditions, including in pediatric and rheumatic diseases. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of creatine supplementation in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus (C-SLE). C-SLE patients with mild disease activity (n = 15) received placebo or creatine supplementation in a randomized fashion using a crossover, double-blind, repeated-measures design. The participants were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks in each arm, interspersed by an eight-week washout period. The primary outcomes were muscle function, as assessed by a battery of tests including one-maximum repetition (1-RM) tests, the timed-up-and-go test, the timed-stands test, and the handgrip test. Secondary outcomes included body composition, biochemical markers of bone remodeling, aerobic conditioning, quality of life, and physical capacity. Possible differences in dietary intake were assessed by three 24-hour dietary recalls. Muscle phosphorylcreatine content was measured through phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31 P-MRS). The safety of the intervention was assessed by laboratory parameters, and kidney function was measured by (51)Cr-EDTA clearance. Additionally, self-reported adverse events were recorded throughout the trial. Intramuscular phosphorylcreatine content was not significantly different between creatine and placebo before or after the intervention (creatine-Pre: 20.5 \u00b1 2.6, Post: 20.4 \u00b1 4.1, placebo-Pre: 19.8 \u00b1 2.0; Post: 20.2 \u00b1 3.2 mmol/kg wet muscle; p = 0.70 for interaction between conditions). In addition, probably as a consequence of the lack of change in intramuscular phosphorylcreatine content, there were no significant changes between placebo and creatine for any muscle function and aerobic conditioning parameters, lean mass, fat mass, bone mass, and quality of life scores (p > 0.05). The (51)Cr-EDTA clearance was not altered by creatine supplementation and no side effects were noticed. A 12-week creatine supplementation protocol at 0.1 g/kg/d is well tolerated and free of adverse effects but did not affect intramuscular phosphorylcreatine, muscle function, free-fat mass or quality of life in non-active C-SLE patients.

          "content": "Controversy exists concerning the effects of higher total protein intake (TPro) on bone health, which may be associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD). However, whey protein (WP) may induce bone formation because of its basic component, milk basic protein. This study assessed the effects of WP supplementation, TPro, and change in TPro (postsupplementation - presupplementation) on BMD and bone mineral content (BMC; total body, lumbar spine, total femur, and femoral neck) in overweight and class I obese middle-aged adults following an exercise intervention. This analysis used data from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 36-wk WP supplementation trial, wherein participants consumed a 1.7-MJ (400-kcal) supplement (0, 20, 40, or 60 g WP/d) along with their otherwise unrestricted diet while participating in a resistance and aerobic exercise intervention (3 d/wk). TPro was the summation of WP and habitual dietary intakes (4-d food record). Statistical analyses for WP were based on group and bone data [n = 186, 108 women; mean \u00b1 SD age: 49 \u00b1 8 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m): 30.1 \u00b1 2.8], whereas TPro was based on dietary and bone data (n = 113, 70 women; age 50 \u00b1 8 y; BMI 30.1 \u00b1 2.9). WP supplementation, regardless of dose, did not influence BMD or BMC following the intervention. By using a multiple linear regression model, TPro (expressed as g/d or g \u00b7 kg \u00b7 d) and change in TPro (expressed as g/d) were not associated with responses over time in total or regional BMD or BMC. By using a cluster analysis approach [<1.0 (n = 41), 1.0-1.2 (n = 28), and \u22651.2 g \u00b7 kg \u00b7 d (n = 44)], TPro was also not associated with responses in total or regional BMD or BMC over time. WP supplementation and total dietary protein intake did not negatively or beneficially influence bone quantity in overweight and obese adults during a 9-mo exercise intervention. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00812409.",

          "content": "The effects of pre-sleep protein supplementation on endurance athletes remain unclear, particularly whether its potential benefits are due to the timing of protein intake or solely to an increased total protein intake. We assessed the effects of pre-sleep protein supplementation in professional cyclists during a training camp accounting for the influence of protein timing. Twenty-four professional U23 cyclists (19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years, peak oxygen uptake: 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9\u00a0ml/kg/min) participated in a six-day training camp. Participants were randomized to consume a protein supplement (40\u00a0g of casein) before sleep (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or in the afternoon (n\u00a0=\u00a08), or an isoenergetic placebo (40\u00a0g of carbohydrates) before sleep (n\u00a0=\u00a08). Indicators of fatigue/recovery (Hooper index, Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes, countermovement jump), body composition, and performance (1-, 5-, and 20-minute time trials, as well as the estimated critical power) were assessed as study outcomes. The training camp resulted in a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) increase in training loads (. training stress score of 659\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0122 per week during the preceding month versus 1207\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0122 during the training camp), which induced an increase in fatigue indicators (e.g. time effect for Hooper index p <\u00a00.001) and a decrease in performance (e.g. time effect for critical power p =\u00a00.002). Protein intake was very high in all the participants (>2.5\u00a0g/kg on average), with significantly higher levels found in the two protein supplement groups compared to the placebo group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No significant between-group differences were found for any of the analyzed outcomes (all p >\u00a00.05). Protein supplementation, whether administered before sleep or earlier in the day, exerts no beneficial effects during a short-term strenuous training period in professional cyclists, who naturally consume a high-protein diet.",

We hypothesized that augmenting dietary intake with high-biologic-value protein would enhance weight and lean tissue in weight-stable subjects with a prior unintentional weight loss of >3%. Fifty-nine subjects with HIV RNA concentrations <5000 copies/mL were randomly assigned to receive a 280-kcal supplement containing 40 g whey protein or a matched isocaloric control supplement without added protein twice daily for 12 wk. Before the study, intake of total energy and protein exceeded estimated requirements (44.3 +/- 12.6 kcal x kg(-1) x d(-1) and 1.69 +/- 0.55 g x kg(-1) x d(-1), respectively). Both supplements failed to increase total energy intake because of decreases in self-selected food intake. Changes in weight (0.8 +/- 2.4 and 0.7 +/- 2.4 kg) and lean body mass (0.3 +/- 1.4 and 0.3 +/- 1.5 kg) did not differ significantly between the whey protein and control groups, respectively. Waist-to-hip ratio improved more with whey protein (-0.02 +/- 0.05) than with the control (0.01 +/- 0.03; P = 0.025) at week 6 but not at week 12. Fasting triacylglycerol increased by 39 +/- 98 mg/dL with the control supplement and decreased by 16 +/- 62 mg/dL with whey protein at week 12 (P = 0.03). CD4 lymphocytes increased by 31 +/- 84 cells/mm(3) with whey protein and decreased by 5 +/- 124 cells/mm(3) with the control supplement at 12 wk (P = 0.03). Gastrointestinal symptoms occurred more often with whey protein. A whey protein supplement did not increase weight or lean body mass in HIV-positive subjects who were eating adequately, but it did increase CD4 cell counts. The control supplement with rapidly assimilable carbohydrate substituted for protein increased cardiovascular disease risk factors. Careful dietary and weight history should be obtained before starting nutritional supplements in subjects with stable weight loss and good viral control.",

To determine the impact of protein supplementation during chronic endurance training on aerobic capacity, body composition and exercise performance in healthy and clinical populations. A systematic database search was conducted for randomised controlled trials addressing the effects of protein supplementation during endurance training on aerobic capacity, body composition and exercise performance in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Meta-analyses were performed to outline the overall effects of protein supplementation with all studies containing endurance training components. The effects of endurance training and add-on effects of protein supplementation were evaluated by the meta-analyses with endurance training-focused studies. Nineteen studies and 1162 participants contributed to the analyses. Compared with the control group, the protein supplementation group demonstrated greater improvements in aerobic capacity measured by mixed peak oxygen uptake (V\u0307O) and peak workload power (W) (standardised mean difference [SMD]\u00a0=\u00a00.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05 to 0.67), and V\u0307O (mean difference [MD]\u00a0=\u00a00.89\u00a0mL\u2027kg\u2027min, 95% CI: 0.07 to 1.70); had a greater lean mass gain (MD\u00a0=\u00a00.32\u00a0kg, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.58); and had a greater improvement in time trial performance (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-29.1s, 95% CI:-55.3 to\u00a0-3.0).

          "content": "This trial aimed to examine the effect of whey protein hydrolysate intake before and after exercise sessions on endurance performance and recovery in elite orienteers during a training camp. Eighteen elite orienteers participated in a randomized controlled intervention trial during a 1-week training camp (13 exercise sessions). Half of the runners (PRO-CHO) ingested a protein drink before (0.3 g kg(-1)) and a protein-carbohydrate drink after (0.3 g protein kg(-1) and 1 g carbohydrate kg(-1)) each exercise session. The others ingested energy and time-matched carbohydrate drinks (CHO). A 4-km run-test with 20 control points was performed before and on the last day of the intervention. Blood and saliva were obtained in the mornings, before and after run-tests, and after the last training session. During the intervention, questionnaires were fulfilled regarding psychological sense of performance capacity and motivation. PRO-CHO and not CHO improved performance in the 4-km run-test (interaction p < .05). An increase in serum creatine kinase was observed during the week, which was greater in CHO than PRO-CHO (interaction p < .01). Lactate dehydrogenase (p < .001) and cortisol (p = .057) increased during the week, but the change did not differ between groups. Reduction in sense of performance capacity during the intervention was greater in CHO (p < .05) than PRO-CHO. In conclusion, ingestion of whey protein hydrolysate before and after each exercise session improves performance and reduces markers of muscle damage during a strenuous 1-week training camp. The results indicate that protein supplementation in conjunction with each exercise session facilitates the recovery from strenuous training in elite orienteers.",

          "content": "The plasma metabolomics profiles of protein intake have been rarely investigated. The aim is to identify the distinct plasma metabolomics profiles associated with overall intakes of protein as well as with intakes from animal and plant protein sources. A cross-sectional analysis using data from 1833 participants at high risk of cardiovascular disease is conducted. Associations between 385 identified metabolites and the intake of total, animal protein (AP), and plant protein (PP), and plant-to-animal ratio (PR) are assessed using elastic net continuous regression analyses. A double 10-cross-validation (CV) procedure is used and Pearson correlations coefficients between multi-metabolite weighted models and reported protein intake in each pair of training-validation datasets are calculated. A wide set of metabolites is consistently associated with each protein source evaluated. These metabolites mainly consisted of amino acids and their derivatives, acylcarnitines, different organic acids, and lipid species. Few metabolites overlapped among protein sources (i.e., C14:0 SM, C20:4 carnitine, GABA, and allantoin) but none of them toward the same direction. Regarding AP and PP approaches, C20:4 carnitine and dimethylglycine are positively associated with PP but negatively associated with AP. However, allantoin, C14:0 SM, C38:7 PE plasmalogen, GABA, metronidazole, and trigonelline (N-methylnicotinate) behave contrarily. Ten-CV Pearson correlation coefficients between self-reported protein intake and plasma metabolomics profiles range from 0.21 for PR to 0.32 for total protein. Different sets of metabolites are associated with total, animal, and plant protein intake. Further studies are needed to assess the contribution of these metabolites in protein biomarkers' discovery and prediction of cardiometabolic alterations.",

          "content": "We evaluated the impact of protein supplementation on adaptations to arduous concurrent training in healthy adults with potential applications to individuals undergoing military training. Peer-reviewed papers published in English meeting the population, intervention, comparison and outcome criteria were included. Database searches were completed in PubMed, Web of science and SPORTDiscus. Study quality was evaluated using the COnsensus based standards for the selection of health status measurement instruments checklist. Of 11 studies included, nine focused on performance, six on body composition and four on muscle recovery. Cohen's d effect sizes showed that protein supplementation improved performance outcomes in response to concurrent training (ES = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.08-1.70). When analysed separately, improvements in muscle strength (SMD = +4.92 kg, 95% CI = -2.70-12.54 kg) were found, but not in aerobic endurance. Gains in fat-free mass (SMD = +0.75 kg, 95% CI = 0.44-1.06 kg) and reductions in fat-mass (SMD = -0.99, 95% CI = -1.43-0.23 kg) were greater with protein supplementation. Most studies did not report protein turnover, nitrogen balance and/or total daily protein intake. Therefore, further research is warranted. However, our findings infer that protein supplementation may support lean-mass accretion and strength gains during arduous concurrent training in physical active populations, including military recruits.",

          "content": "Studies assessing the effects of protein supplementation on changes in body composition (BC) and health rarely consider the impact of total protein intake (TPro) or the change in TPro (CTPro) from participants' usual diets. This secondary data analysis assessed the impact of TPro and CTPro on changes in BC and metabolic syndrome (MetS) indexes in overweight and obese middle-aged adults who participated in an exercise training program. Men and women [n = 117; age: 50 \u00b1 0.7 y, body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)): 30.1 \u00b1 0.3; means \u00b1 SEs] performed resistance exercise 2 d/wk and aerobic exercise 1 d/wk and consumed an unrestricted diet along with 200-kcal supplements (0, 10, 20, or 30 g whey protein) twice daily for 36 wk. Protein intake was assessed via 4-d food records. Multiple linear regression model and stratified analysis were applied for data analyses. Among all subjects, TPro and CTPro were inversely associated (P < 0.05) with changes in body mass, fat mass (FM), and BMI. Changes in BC were different (P < 0.05) among groups that consumed <1.0 (n = 43) vs. \u22651.0 to <1.2 (n = 29) vs. \u22651.2 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (n = 45). The TPro group with \u22651.0 to <1.2 g \u00b7: kg(-1) \u00b7: d(-1) reduced FM and %FM and increased percentage of LM (%LM) compared with the lowest TPro group, whereas the TPro group with \u22651.2 g \u00b7: kg(-1) \u00b7: d(-1) presented intermediate responses on changes in FM, %FM, and %LM. The gain in LM was not different among groups. In addition, MetS indexes were not influenced by TPro and CTPro. In conjunction with exercise training, higher TPro promoted positive changes in BC but not in MetS indexes in overweight and obese middle-aged adults. Changes in TPro from before to during the intervention also influenced BC responses and should be considered in future research when different TPro is achieved via diet or supplements. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00812409.",

          "content": "We examined the effect of a protein supplement on muscular strength and body composition during 6 months of a 5 days/week concurrent strength and endurance training program. Sedentary males (n\u2009=\u200926) and females (n\u2009=\u200925), 18-25 years, were randomly assigned to receive a protein (PRO, 42\u00a0g/serving) or carbohydrate (CON) supplement twice daily. Strength and body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were assessed at baseline, 3 (3M), and 6 (6M) months. Protein intake was higher in PRO (PRO: 2.2\u00a0g/kg; CON: 1.1\u00a0g/kg; p\u2009<\u2009.001). Females in both groups gained similar strength at 3M and 6M in bench press and hip sled. Males in PRO gained more bench press strength at 3M (PRO: 24.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2\u00a0kg; CON: 14.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8\u00a0kg; p\u2009=\u2009.06) and 6M (PRO: 34.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3\u00a0kg; CON: 18.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1\u00a0kg; p\u2009=\u2009.03) and hip sled strength at 3M (PRO: 67.7\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2\u00a0kg; CON: 40.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.8\u00a0kg, p\u2009=\u2009.07) and 6M (PRO: 94.0\u2009\u00b1\u200910.6\u00a0kg; CON: 65.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.4\u00a0kg; p\u2009=\u2009.09) compared with CON.

          "content": "Protein ingestion and the ensuing hyperaminoacidemia stimulates skeletal muscle protein synthesis in the postexercise period. This response facilitates muscle remodeling, which is important during intensified training. The aim of this study was to determine whether supplementation with \u03b1-lactalbumin (LA), with high leucine and tryptophan contents, would improve responses to short periods of intensified aerobic training compared with supplementation with an isonitrogenous quantity of collagen peptides (CP). Endurance-trained participants (5 male, 6 female, 24 \u00b1 4 yr, V\u02d9O2 = 53.2 \u00b1 9.1 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min, peak power output = 320 \u00b1 48 W; means \u00b1 SD) consumed a controlled diet (1.0 g\u00b7kg\u00b7d protein) and refrained from habitual training for 11 d while taking part in this double-blind randomized, crossover trial. The two intervention phases, which consisted of brief intensified training (4 \u00d7 4-min cycling intervals at 70% of peak power output on 3 consecutive days) combined with the ingestion of LA or CP supplements after exercise (20 g) and before sleep (40 g), were separated by 4 d of washout without protein supplementation (i.e., the control phase). In response to each phase, myofibrillar (MyoPS), sarcoplasmic protein synthesis (SarcPS) rates (via H2O ingestion) and parameters of sleep quality were measured. LA ingestion increased plasma leucine (P < 0.001) and tryptophan concentrations (P < 0.001) relative to CP. Intensified training increased MyoPS and SarcPS above the washout phase in LA- and CP-supplemented phases (P < 0.01), with increases being 13% \u00b1 5% and 5% \u00b1 7% greater with LA than CP for MyoPS (P < 0.01) and SarcPS, respectively (P < 0.01). Despite an isonitrogenous diet, protein synthesis was enhanced to a greater extent when trained participants consumed LA compared with CP during intensified aerobic training, suggesting that protein quality is an important consideration for endurance-trained athletes aiming to augment adaption to exercise training.",

          "content": "The aim was to quantify the proportion of the literature on caffeine supplementation that reports habitual caffeine consumption, and determine the influence of habitual consumption on the acute exercise response to caffeine supplementation, using a systematic review and meta-analytic approach. Three databases were searched, and articles screened according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Three-level meta-analyses and meta-regression models were used to investigate the influence of habitual caffeine consumption on caffeine's overall ergogenic effect and within different exercise types (endurance, power, strength), in men and women, and in trained and untrained individuals. Sub-analyses were performed according to the following: acute relative dose (<\u20093, 3-6, >\u20096\u00a0mg/kg body mass [BM]); whether the acute caffeine dose provided was lower or higher than the mean daily caffeine dose; and the caffeine withdrawal period prior to the intervention (<\u200924, 24-48, >\u200948\u00a0h). Sixty caffeine studies included sufficient information on habitual consumption to be included in the meta-analysis. A positive overall effect of caffeine was shown in comparison to placebo (standard mean difference [SMD]\u2009=\u20090.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.30; p\u2009<\u20090.001) with no influence of relative habitual caffeine consumption (p\u2009=\u20090.59). Subgroup analyses showed a significant ergogenic effect when the caffeine dose was\u2009<\u20093\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.40; p\u2009=\u20090.003) and 3-6\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.21-0.32; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), but not\u2009>\u20096\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.11, 95% CI\u2009-\u20090.07 to 0.30; p\u2009=\u20090.23); when the dose was both higher (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.20-0.31; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and lower (SMD\u2009=\u20090.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.36; p\u2009=\u20090.006) than the habitual caffeine dose; and when withdrawal was\u2009<\u200924\u00a0h, 24-48\u00a0h, and\u2009>\u200948\u00a0h. Caffeine was effective for endurance, power, and strength exercise, with no influence (all p\u2009\u2265\u20090.23) of relative habitual caffeine consumption within exercise types. Habitual caffeine consumption did not modify the ergogenic effect of caffeine in male, female, trained or untrained individuals. Habitual caffeine consumption does not appear to influence the acute ergogenic effect of caffeine.",

          "content": "This study investigated the effect of caffeine on physical performance in healthy citizens aged > or =70 yr. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted in 15 men and 15 women recruited by their general practitioner. Participants abstained from caffeine for 48 h and were randomized to receive one capsule of placebo and then caffeine (6 mg/kg) or caffeine and then placebo with 1 wk in between. One hour after intervention, we measured reaction and movement times, postural stability, walking speed, cycling at 65% of expected maximal heart rate, perceived effort during cycling, maximal isometric arm flexion strength, and endurance. Analysis was by intention to treat, and P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Caffeine increased cycling endurance by 25% [95% confidence interval (CI): 13-38; P = 0.0001] and isometric arm flexion endurance by 54% (95% CI: 29-83; P = 0.0001). Caffeine also reduced the rating of perceived exertion after 5 min of cycling by 11% (95% CI: 5-17; P = 0.002) and postural stability with eyes open by 25% (95% CI: 2-53; P = 0.03). Caffeine ingestion did not affect muscle strength, walking speed, reaction, and movement times. At the end of the study, 46% of participants correctly identified when they received caffeine and placebo. Caffeine increased exercise endurance in healthy citizens aged > or =70 yr, but the participants' reasons for stopping the test may have varied between subjects, as the cycling test was done at approximately 55% of maximal oxygen consumption. Further studies are required to investigate whether caffeine can be utilized to improve the physical performance of elderly citizens.",

          "content": "Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the research literature assessing the effect of caffeine ingestion on maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) strength and muscular endurance. Thirty-four relevant studies between 1939 and 2008 were included in the meta-analyses of caffeine's effects on MVC strength (n = 27 studies) and muscular endurance (n = 23 studies). Effect sizes (ES) were calculated as the standardized mean difference and meta-analyses were completed using a random-effects model. Overall, caffeine ingestion was found to result in a small beneficial effect on MVC strength (overall ES = 0.19, P = 0.0003). However, caffeine appears to improve MVC strength primarily in the knee extensors (i.e., by approximately 7%, ES = 0.37) and not in other muscle groups such as the forearm or the knee flexors. In an attempt to offer a physiological mechanism behind caffeine's ability to improve MVC strength, a meta-analysis was run on ES from nine studies that measured percent muscle activation during MVC in trials comparing caffeine versus placebo; the overall ES (0.67) was highly significant (P = 0.00008) and of moderate to large size, thus implicating an effect of caffeine on the CNS. Caffeine ingestion was also found to exert a small beneficial effect on muscular endurance (overall ES = 0.28, P = 0.00005). However, it appears caffeine improves muscular endurance only when it is assessed using open (i.e., by approximately 18%, ES = 0.37) and not fixed end point tests. Overall, caffeine ingestion improves MVC strength and muscular endurance. The effect on strength appears exclusively in the knee extensors, and the effect on muscular endurance appears only detectable with open end point tests.",

          "content": "Caffeine, widely recognized as an ergogenic aid, has undergone extensive research, demonstrating its effectiveness to enhance endurance performance. However, there remains a significant gap in systematically evaluating its effects on time trial (TT) performance in cyclists. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the efficacy of caffeine ingestion to increase cycling TT performance in cyclists and to evaluate the optimal dosage range for maximum effect. A search of four databases was completed on 1 December 2023. The selected studies comprised crossover, placebo-controlled investigations into the effects of caffeine ingestion on cycling TT performance. Completion time (Time) and mean power output (MPO) were used as performance measures for TT. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model to assess the standardized mean differences (SMD) in individual studies. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analyses. Subgroup analysis showed that moderate doses of caffeine intake (4-6\u2009mg/kg) significantly improved cycling performance (SMD \u2009=\u2009-0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u2009-0.84\u2009~\u2009-0.26, \u2009<\u20090.01, \u2009=\u200935%; SMD \u2009=\u20090.44, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.09\u2009~\u20090.79, \u2009<\u20090.05, \u2009=\u200939%), while the effects of low doses (1-3\u2009mg/kg) of caffeine were not significant (SMD \u2009=\u2009-0.34, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.84\u2009~\u20090.17, \u2009=\u20090.19, \u2009=\u20090%; SMD \u2009=\u20090.31, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.02\u2009~\u20090.65, \u2009=\u20090.07, \u2009=\u20090%). A moderate dosage (4-6\u2009mg/kg) of caffeine, identified as the optimal dose range, can significantly improve the time trial performance of cyclists, while a low dose (1-3\u2009mg/kg) does not yield improvement. In addition, the improvements in completion time and mean power output resulting from a moderate dose of caffeine are essentially the same in cycling time trails.",

          "content": "The benefits of oral caffeine intake to enhance several aspects of physical performance, such as aerobic endurance, strength, power, and muscle endurance performance, are well supported. However, how the physical performance benefits of caffeine supplementation are translated into better specific actions in intermittent sports during real or simulated competition has been the topic of fewer investigations, and their results need to be appropriately reviewed and meta-analyzed. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of acute caffeine intake on specific actions in intermittent sports involving decision making and high-intensity efforts (eg,\u00a0team, racket, and combat sports) during real or simulated competitions. All studies included had blinded and crossover experimental designs, and we conducted a risk-of-bias analysis. In total, we included 24 studies. A meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) estimated by Hedges g and 95% CIs. Caffeine ingestion increased high-intensity sport-specific actions during competition, such as the number of sprints (SMD: 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-0.74), body impacts (SMD: 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49), accelerations (SMD: 0.35; 95% CI, 0.06-0.63), decelerations (SMD: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.12-1.14), and high-intensity offensive efforts (SMD: 0.36; 95% CI, 0.11-0.61). Additionally, caffeine ingestion induced a higher positive or success rate of actions during real or simulated competition (SMD: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69). The current meta-analysis provides evidence of caffeine supplementation in increasing high-intensity efforts and the success rate of sport-specific actions during real or simulated competition.",

          "content": "In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that caffeine would increase endurance performance via attenuation of neural and muscular determinants of performance fatigability during high-intensity, whole-body exercise. Ten healthy males cycled until exhaustion (89% \u00b1 2% of V\u0307O2max) after the ingestion of caffeine or placebo. During another four visits, the same exercise was performed after either caffeine or placebo ingestion but with exercise discontinued after completing either 50% or 75% of the duration of placebo trial. An additional trial with caffeine ingestion was also performed with interruption at the placebo time to exhaustion (isotime). Performance fatigability was measured via changes in maximal voluntary contraction, whereas neural and muscular determinants of performance fatigability were quantified via preexercise to postexercise decrease in quadriceps voluntary activation (VA) and potentiated twitch force, respectively. Compared with the placebo, caffeine increased time to exhaustion (+14.4 \u00b1 1.6%, P = 0.017, 314.4 \u00b1 47.9 vs 354.9 \u00b1 40.8 s). Caffeine did not change the rate of decline in maximal voluntary contraction (P = 0.209), but caffeine reduced the twitch force decline at isotime when stimulating at single twitch (-58.6 \u00b1 22.4 vs -45.7 \u00b1 21.9%, P = 0.014) and paired 10 Hz electrical stimuli (-37.3 \u00b1 13.2 vs -28.2 \u00b1 12.9%, P = 0.025), and reduced the amplitude of electromyography signal during cycling at isotime (P = 0.034). The decline in VA throughout the trial was lower (P = 0.004) with caffeine (-0.5 \u00b1 4.2%) than with placebo (-5.8 \u00b1 8.5%). Caffeine also maintained peripheral oxygen saturation at higher levels (95.0 \u00b1 1.9%) than placebo (92.0 \u00b1 6.2%, P = 0.016).

          "title": "Sex-specific impacts of caffeine on body composition: commentary on a retrospective cohort study.",
          "content": "Understanding the impact of caffeine intake on body composition is a topic of growing research interest. The article \"Association Between Caffeine Intake and Fat-Free Mass Index: A Retrospective Cohort Study\" by Tian et al. explored this relationship, highlighting a positive correlation between caffeine consumption and fat-free mass index (FFMI). In this letter to the editor, we discuss the broader implications of these findings, emphasizing the need for further exploration of the underlying biological and lifestyle factors influencing caffeine's effects. To provide critical insights into the mechanisms and contextual factors that may explain the observed association between caffeine intake and FFMI, with particular focus on sex-specific differences, hormonal influences, and lifestyle interactions. This letter to editor builds on the findings of Tian et al., drawing from related literature and prior research to contextualize the potential mechanisms and broader implications of caffeine's impact on body composition. The discussion highlights key areas requiring further investigation, including the role of hormonal modulation, genetic variability, and long-term effects on muscle health. The positive association between caffeine intake and FFMI, particularly among women and younger populations, underscores the ergogenic potential of caffeine in enhancing muscle performance and metabolic efficiency. This letter expands on the study by emphasizing the role of hormonal factors, such as estrogen's modulation of CYP1A2, the liver enzyme critical for caffeine metabolism. The discussion also highlights the complex interplay between caffeine and other lifestyle factors. Finally, this commentary calls attention to the need for more research into the differential effects of caffeine sources, such as energy drinks and supplements, which often include additional ingredients with distinct metabolic and cardiovascular effects. These alternative sources may influence body composition differently than traditional coffee-based caffeine intake, an area that remains underexplored.",

          "title": "Caffeine use in sports. A pharmacological review.",
          "content": "Caffeine is the most widely ingested psychoactive drug in the world. As many know, chronic use of caffeine leads to dependence, tolerance, drug craving, and upon abrupt cessation unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Thus, caffeine fulfills pharmacological criteria by which agents are classified as drugs of abuse. Nevertheless, its use is legal and only at high, but readily attainable, levels is it banned from sport. Its use is widespread by athletes as young as 11 years of age who are seeking athletic advantage over fellow competitors. It is likely that its use will not decline any time soon because it is inexpensive, readily available, medically quite safe, socially acceptable, and by most measures legal. However, at levels allowed in sport, caffeine through its wide-ranging physiological and psychological effects increases endurance in well-trained athletes. If the goal of drug-testing and education programs in sport is to protect the health of athletes, prevent unfair advantage (cheating) and encourage ethical behavior then it seems obvious that the allowable levels of caffeine ingestion should be decreased. The alternative is to continue with policies designed largely to punish only those that get caught.",

          "content": "Following critical evaluation of the available literature to date, The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) position regarding caffeine intake is as follows: 1. Supplementation with caffeine has been shown to acutely enhance various aspects of exercise performance in many but not all studies. Small to moderate benefits of caffeine use include, but are not limited to: muscular endurance, movement velocity and muscular strength, sprinting, jumping, and throwing performance, as well as a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic sport-specific actions. 2. Aerobic endurance appears to be the form of exercise with the most consistent moderate-to-large benefits from caffeine use, although the magnitude of its effects differs between individuals. 3. Caffeine has consistently been shown to improve exercise performance when consumed in doses of 3-6\u2009mg/kg body mass. Minimal effective doses of caffeine currently remain unclear but they may be as low as 2\u2009mg/kg body mass. Very high doses of caffeine (e.g. 9\u2009mg/kg) are associated with a high incidence of side-effects and do not seem to be required to elicit an ergogenic effect. 4. The most commonly used timing of caffeine supplementation is 60\u2009min pre-exercise. Optimal timing of caffeine ingestion likely depends on the source of caffeine. For example, as compared to caffeine capsules, caffeine chewing gums may require a shorter waiting time from consumption to the start of the exercise session. 5. Caffeine appears to improve physical performance in both trained and untrained individuals. 6. Inter-individual differences in sport and exercise performance as well as adverse effects on sleep or feelings of anxiety following caffeine ingestion may be attributed to genetic variation associated with caffeine metabolism, and physical and psychological response. Other factors such as habitual caffeine intake also may play a role in between-individual response variation. 7. Caffeine has been shown to be ergogenic for cognitive function, including attention and vigilance, in most individuals. 8. Caffeine may improve cognitive and physical performance in some individuals under conditions of sleep deprivation. 9. The use of caffeine in conjunction with endurance exercise in the heat and at altitude is well supported when dosages range from 3 to 6\u2009mg/kg and 4-6\u2009mg/kg, respectively. 10. Alternative sources of caffeine such as caffeinated chewing gum, mouth rinses, energy gels and chews have been shown to improve performance, primarily in aerobic exercise. 11. Energy drinks and pre-workout supplements containing caffeine have been demonstrated to enhance both anaerobic and aerobic performance.",

          "content": "Intake of caffeinated beverages might be associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality possibly via the lowering of blood pressure. We estimated the association of ambulatory blood pressure with urinary caffeine and caffeine metabolites in a population-based sample. Families were randomly selected from the general population of Swiss cities. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was conducted using validated devices. Urinary caffeine, paraxanthine, theophylline, and theobromine excretions were measured in 24 hours urine using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We used mixed models to explore the associations of urinary excretions with blood pressure although adjusting for major confounders. The 836 participants (48.9% men) included in this analysis had mean age of 47.8 and mean 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 120.1 and 78.0 mm Hg. For each doubling of caffeine excretion, 24-hour and night-time systolic blood pressure decreased by 0.642 and 1.107 mm Hg (both P values <0.040). Similar inverse associations were observed for paraxanthine and theophylline. Adjusted night-time systolic blood pressure in the first (lowest), second, third, and fourth (highest) quartile of paraxanthine urinary excretions were 110.3, 107.3, 107.3, and 105.1 mm Hg, respectively (P trend <0.05). No associations of urinary excretions with diastolic blood pressure were generally found, and theobromine excretion was not associated with blood pressure. Anti-hypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol consumption modify the association of caffeine urinary excretion with systolic blood pressure. Ambulatory systolic blood pressure was inversely associated with urinary excretions of caffeine and other caffeine metabolites. Our results are compatible with a potential protective effect of caffeine on blood pressure.",

          "title": "Caffeine potentiates low frequency skeletal muscle force in habitual and nonhabitual caffeine consumers.",
          "content": "The mechanism of action underlying the ergogenic effect of caffeine is still unclear. Caffeine increases the force of muscular contraction during low-frequency stimulation by potentiating calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Studies have also suggested an enhancement of lipid oxidation and glycogen sparing as potential mechanisms. Given that several studies have found an ergogenic effect of caffeine with no apparent metabolic effects, it is likely that a direct effect upon muscle is important. Twelve healthy male subjects were classified as habitual (n = 6) or nonhabitual (n = 6) caffeine consumers based on a 4-day diet record analysis, with a mean caffeine consumption of 771 and 14 mg/day for each group, respectively. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive caffeine (6 mg/kg) and placebo (citrate) in a double-blind, cross-over fashion approximately 100 min before a 2-min tetanic stimulation of the common peroneal nerve in a custom-made dynamometer (2 trials each of 20 and 40 Hz). Tetanic torque was measured every 30 s during and at 1, 5, and 15 min after the stimulation protocol. Maximal voluntary contraction strength and peak twitch torque were measured before and after the stimulation protocol. Caffeine potentiated the force of contraction during the final minute of the 20-Hz stimulation (P<0.05) with no effect of habituation. There was no effect of caffeine on 40-Hz stimulation strength nor was there an effect on maximal voluntary contraction or peak twitch torque. These data support the hypothesis that some of the ergogenic effect of caffeine in endurance exercise performance occurs directly at the skeletal muscle level.",

This randomized, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of combined versus single supplementation of creatine (Cr), beta-alanine (BA), and L-citrulline (L-Cit) during short sprint interval training (SSIT)\u00a0on basketball players' physical and physiological performance over a period of 28\u00a0days. Forty-eight basketball players were equally assigned to 6 groups of Cr (0.1\u00a0g/kg of Cr monohydrate daily), BA (4.8\u00a0g daily), L-Cit (6\u00a0g daily), combined supplementation, PL, and an active control group, and each group consisted of 8 participants. The training groups participated in SSIT (3 sets of 10 repetitions of 5-s all-out runs) sessions 3 times a week for 4\u00a0weeks. Physical (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Illinois change of direction) and physiological (Wingate anaerobic power and cardiorespiratory fitness test) performance were evaluated before and after the training period. All training groups (Cr, BA, L-Cit, combined, and PL) showed significant improvements in physical and physiological performance over the 4-week intervention (P < .05). Interestingly, the supplement groups displayed significantly (P = .001) greater changes than the PL group, indicating better outcomes in performance adaptations. However, significant differences in performance variables were observed among the supplement groups. Our findings indicate that short-term supplementation with Cr, BA, and L-Cit, as well as a combination of them during SSIT, can significantly improve the physical and physiological performance of basketball players compared to a PL.",

          "title": "Ergonutrition Supplementation and Recovery in Water Polo: A Systematic Review.",
          "content": "Water polo (WP) is a high-intensity team sport that requires a combination of physical endurance, muscular strength, speed, and specific technical skills. Due to the demanding and prolonged nature of this sport, adequate and balanced nutrition plays a fundamental role in athletes' performance, recovery, and overall health maintenance. We aimed to compile all available information on the importance of ergonutrition and supplementation in the recovery of WP players. This will help in understanding this sport's specific challenges and requirements, enabling players and coaches to design more effective recovery plans to optimize performance, achieve goals, and successfully cope with intense training and competition. English-language publications were searched in databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO Citation Index, Medline (PubMed), KCI Korean Journal Database, and Current Contents Connect using a series of keywords such as WP, nutrition, recovery, and ergogenic aids individually or in combination. In the field of ergonutritional recovery in WP, certain supplements such as whey protein, beta-alanine, L-arginine, spirulina, and copper can be beneficial for improving performance and recovery. In some cases, WP athletes may consider using ergogenic supplements to further improve their performance and recovery process. However, it is important to bear in mind that any supplement should be carefully evaluated under the supervision of a health professional or a sports nutritionist, as some supplements may present side effects or unwanted interactions. Adequate ergogenic nutrition adapted to the needs of WP players is essential not only to optimize their athletic performance but also to ensure effective recovery and maintain their long-term health and general well-being. The application of these strategies should be evidence-based and tailored to the individual needs of the players and the specific demands of the sport. Future experimental research that can confirm our results is essential.",

          "content": "Beta-alanine is a nonessential amino acid that is commonly used to improve exercise performance. It could influence the buffering of hydrogen ions produced during intense exercise and delay fatigue, providing a substrate for increased synthesis of intramuscular carnosine. This systematic review evaluates the effects of beta-alanine supplementation on maximal intensity exercise in trained, young, male individuals. Six databases were searched on August 10, 2023, to identify randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effect of chronic beta-alanine supplementation in trained male individuals with an age range of 18-40\u00a0years. Studies evaluating exercise performance through maximal or supramaximal intensity efforts falling within the 0.5-10\u00a0min duration were included. A total of 18 individual studies were analyzed, employing 18 exercise test protocols and 15 outcome measures in 331 participants. A significant (p = .01) result was observed with an overall effect size of 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.09, 0.69]), in favor of beta-alanine supplementation versus placebo. Results indicate significant effects at 4\u00a0weeks of supplementation, effect size 0.34 (95% CI [0.02, 0.67], p = .04); 4-10\u00a0min of maximal effort, effect size 0.55 (95% CI [0.07, 1.04], p = .03); and a high beta-alanine dosage of 5.6-6.4\u00a0g per day, effect size 0.35 (95% CI [0.09, 0.62], p = .009). The results provide insights into which exercise modality will benefit the most, and which dosage protocols and durations stand to provide the greatest ergogenic effects. This may be used to inform further research, and professional or recreational training design, and optimization of supplementation strategies.",

A random-effects model and the standardized mean differences (SMD) \u00b1 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. The results showed that caffeine helped to improve jumping performance, isometric strength values, and the number of repetitions until failure. Caffeine and sodium phosphate helped to improve sprint performance. Aerobic tests could be improved with the use of taurine, caffeine, and beta-alanine. No conclusive effects of beetroot juice, polyphenols, or creatine in improving aerobic performance were shown. In terms of anaerobic variables, both caffeine and sodium phosphate could help to improve repeated sprint ability. More studies are needed in female athletes that measure the effects of different EAs on sports performance, such as beetroot juice, beta-alanine or sodium phosphate, as the studies to date are scarce and there are many types of EA that need to be further considered in this population, such as creatine and taurine.",

          "content": "Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation increases muscle carnosine, an abundant endogenous antioxidant and pH buffer in skeletal muscle. Carnosine loading promotes exercise capacity in healthy older adults. As patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suffer from elevated exercise-induced muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress and acidosis, and from reduced muscle carnosine stores, it was investigated whether BA supplementation augments muscle carnosine and induces beneficial changes in exercise capacity, quadriceps function, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress in patients with COPD. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo (PL)-controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02770417), 40 patients (75% male) with COPD (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation: age 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0years; FEV % predicted 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014%) were assigned to 12\u00a0weeks oral BA or PL supplementation (3.2\u00a0g/day). The primary outcome, i.e. muscle carnosine, was quantified from m. vastus lateralis biopsies obtained before and after intervention. Co-primary outcomes, i.e. incremental and constant work rate cycle capacity, were also assessed. Linear mixed model analyses were performed. Compliance with and side effects of supplement intake and secondary outcomes (quadriceps strength and endurance, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress) were also assessed. Beta-alanine supplementation increased muscle carnosine in comparison with PL in patients with COPD (mean difference [95% confidence interval]; +2.82 [1.49-4.14] mmol/kg wet weight; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Maximal incremental cycling capacity (VO peak: +0.5 [-0.7 to 1.7] mL/kg/min; P\u00a0=\u00a00.384, Wpeak: +5 [-1 to 11] W; P\u00a0=\u00a00.103) and time to exhaustion on the constant work rate cycle test (+28 [-179 to 236] s; P\u00a0=\u00a00.782) did not change significantly.

          "content": "Exercise intolerance is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and, although multifactorial, it is largely caused by lower-limb muscle dysfunction. Research has shown that patients with severe to very severe COPD have significantly lower levels of muscle carnosine, which acts as a pH buffer and antioxidant. Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation has been shown to consistently elevate muscle carnosine in a variety of populations and may therefore improve exercise tolerance and lower-limb muscle function. The primary objective of the current studies is to assess the beneficial effects of BA supplementation in enhancing exercise tolerance on top of two types of exercise training (non-linear periodised exercise (NLPE) training or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)) in patients with COPD. Two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have been designed. Patients will routinely receive either NLPE (BASE-TRAIN trial) or NMES (BASE-ELECTRIC trial) as part of standard exercise-based care during their 8-to-10 week pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme. A total of 222 patients with COPD (2\u00d777 = 154 patients in the BASE-TRAIN trial and 2\u00d734 = 68 patients in the BASE-ELECTRIC trial) will be recruited from two specialised PR centres in The Netherlands. For study purposes, patients will receive 3.2 g of oral BA supplementation or placebo per day. Exercise tolerance is the primary outcome, which will be assessed using the endurance shuttle walk test (BASE-TRAIN) or the constant work rate cycle test (BASE-ELECTRIC). Furthermore, quadriceps muscle strength and endurance, cognitive function, carnosine levels (in muscle), BA levels (in blood and muscle), markers of oxidative stress and inflammation (in blood, muscles and lungs), physical activity and quality of life will be measured. Both trials were approved by CMO Regio Arnhem-Nijmegen, The Netherlands (NL70781.091.19. and NL68757.091.19). NTR8427 (BASE-TRAIN) and NTR8419 (BASE-ELECTRIC).",

Due to its efficacy, already proven in the literature, to increase the intramuscular carnosine content (\u03b2-alanyl-L-histidine), whose main function is intramuscular buffering, \u03b2-alanine supplementation has become a nutritional strategy to improve performance, mainly in high-intensity efforts. However, although many studies present evidence of the efficacy of \u03b2-alanine supplementation in high-intensity efforts, discrepancies in outcomes are still present and the performance enhancing effects seem to be related to the specificities of each sport discipline, making it difficult for athletes/coaches to interpret the efficacy of \u03b2-alanine supplementation. Thus, this study carried out a review of the literature on this topic and summarized, analyzed, and critically discussed the findings with the objective of clarifying the current evidence found in the literature on different types of efforts and sport modalities. The present review revealed that inconsistencies are still found in aerobic parameters determined in incremental tests, except for physical working capacity at the neuromuscular fatigue threshold. Inconsistencies are also found for strength exercises and intermittent high-intensity efforts, whereas in supramaximal continuous mode intermittent exercise, the beneficial evidence is strong. In sports modalities, the evidence should be analyzed separately for each sporting modality. Thus, sports modalities that have strong evidence of the ergogenic effects of \u03b2-alanine supplementation are: cycling race of 4 km, rowing race of 2,000 m, swimming race of 100 and 200 m, combat modalities, and water polo. Finally, there is some evidence of slight additional effects on physical performance from cosupplementation with sodium bicarbonate.",

The aim of this study was to conduct a review of the use of BA supplementation as an ergogenic aid to improve performance and fatigue resistance in athletes and non-athletes. In this systematic review, a search in PubMed and Bireme databases was performed for the terms \"beta-alanine,\" \"beta-alanine and exercise,\" \"carnosine\" or \"carnosine and exercise\" in the titles or abstracts. We included randomized, clinical trials published between 2005 and 2015. Twenty-three studies were selected. Most of them included physically active individuals. The mean intervention period was 5.2\u00b11.8 weeks, and mean BA dose was 4.8\u00b11.3 g/day. The main outcome measures were blood lactate, pH, perceived exertion, power and physical working capacity at fatigue threshold. After BA supplementation, no statistically significant difference was observed in total work, exercise performance time, oxygen consumption and time to exhaustion. BA supplementation seems to improve perceived exertion and biochemical parameters related to muscle fatigue and less evidence was found for improvement in performance.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of beta-alanine supplementation on body composition indices. Online databases, including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, were searched up to April 2021 to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which examined the effect of beta-alanine supplementation on body composition indices. Meta-analyses were carried out using a random-effects model. The I index was used to assess the heterogeneity of RCTs. Among the initial 1413 studies that were identified from electronic databases search, 20 studies involving 492 participants were eligible. Pooled effect size from 20 studies indicated that beta-alanine supplementation has no effect on body mass (WMD: -0.15 kg; 95% CI: -0.78 to 0.47;  =\u00a00.631, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.998), fat mass (FM) (WMD: -0.24 kg; 95% CI: -1.16 to 0.68;  =\u00a00.612, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.969), body fat percentage (BFP) (WMD: -0.06%; 95% CI: -0.53 to 0.40;  =\u00a00.782, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.936), and fat-free mass (FFM) (WMD: 0.05 kg; 95% CI: -0.71 to 0.82;  =\u00a00.889, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.912). Subgroup analyses based on exercise type (resistance training [RT], endurance training [ET], and combined training [CT]), study duration (<8 and \u22658\u00a0weeks), and beta-alanine dosage (<6 and \u22656\u00a0g/d) demonstrated similar results. Certainty of evidence across outcomes ranged from low to moderate. This meta-analysis study suggests that beta-alanine supplementation is unlikely to improve body composition indices regardless of supplementation dosage and its combination with exercise training. No studies have examined the effect of beta-alanine combined with both diet and exercise on body composition changes as the primary variable. Therefore, future studies examining the effect of the combination of beta-alanine supplementation with a hypocaloric diet and exercise programs are warranted.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of \u03b2-alanine supplementation on high-intensity running performance and critical velocity (CV) and anaerobic running capacity (ARC). Fifty recreationally trained men were randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to a \u03b2-alanine group (BA, 2 \u00d7 800 mg tablets, 3 times daily; CarnoSyn; n = 26) or placebo group (PL, 2 \u00d7 800 mg maltodextrin tablets, 3 times daily; n = 24). A graded exercise test (GXT) was performed to establish peak velocity (PV). Three high-speed runs to exhaustion were performed at 110, 100, and 90% of PV, with 15 minutes of rest between bouts. The distances achieved were plotted over the time to exhaustion (TTE). Linear regression was used to determine the slope (CV) and y-intercept (ARC) of these relationships to assess aerobic and anaerobic performances, respectively. There were no significant treatment effects (p > 0.05) on CV or ARC for either men or women. Additionally, no TTE effects were evident for bouts at 90-110%PV lasting 1.95-5.06 minutes. There seems to be no ergogenic effect of \u03b2-alanine supplementation on CV, ARC, or high-intensity running lasting approximately 2-5 minutes in either men or women in the current study.",

Sixteen trained futsal players participated in a randomized, parallel, double-blind experiment, completing a two-week supplementation period with either 12 g/day of BA (\u2009=\u20098; age: 19\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009years; height: 1.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u2009m; body mass: 68.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4\u2009kg) or a placebo (PLA) (\u2009=\u20098; age: 18\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009years; height: 1.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u2009m; body mass: 65.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u2009kg). Athletes completed the futsal intermittent endurance test (FIET) and a 30-m speed test before and after supplementation. Plasma lactate levels were measured before, immediately after, and three minutes post-FIET, while RPE was assessed during each FIET stage. There was a significant main effect of time for distance covered in the FIET (Pre-BA: 1618.13\u2009\u00b1\u2009268.14\u2009m; Post-BA: 1857.50\u2009\u00b1\u2009277.81\u2009m; Pre-PLA: 1519.13\u2009\u00b1\u2009243.19\u2009m; Post-PLA: 1621.88\u2009\u00b1\u2009323.65\u2009m; \u2009=\u20090.003; \u03b7p \u2009=\u20090.73), while no significant interaction effect was revealed for FIET (\u2009=\u20090.147; \u03b7p \u2009=\u20090.27).

          "content": "Following an extensive literature review, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) has developed an official position on nutritional and weight cut strategies for combat sports. The type of combat sport, length of the fight camp, and time between weigh-in and competition are factors influencing nutritional and weight cut strategies. The following 16 points constitute the Position Statement of the Society; the Research Committee has approved them. 1. Combat sports have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and competition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and weight cut strategies for training and competition. 2. As the duration of a combat match increases, >4 min, contribution of the aerobic system can rise to\u2009>70%, yet anaerobic alactic pathways and anaerobic glycolytic pathways support high-output bursts. 3. During the off camp/general preparation phase, athletes should maintain a weight ranging 12% to 15% above the weight division requirement. 4. Supplements including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance performance and/or recovery during preparation phases, competition, and post-competition. 5. During fight camp, strategic decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an efficient longitudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be determined using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such as Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham. 6. Protein should be prioritized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean body mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports training demands. Macronutrients should not drop below the following: carbohydrates 3.0-4.0\u2009g/kg, protein 1.2-2.0\u2009g/kg, and fat 0.5 to 1.0\u2009g/kg/day. 7. Suitable losses in body mass range from 6.7% at 72\u00a0h, 5.7% at 48\u00a0h, and 4.4% at 24\u00a0h, prior to weigh-in. 8. Sodium restriction and water loading are effective for inducing polyuria and acute water loss. 9. During fight week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through exercise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1% to 2% loss in body mass, with equivalent losses from a low-fiber intake of <10\u2009g/day for 4\u2009days. 10. During fight week, acute water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immersion, and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate supervision (optimally ~2-4% of body mass within 24\u00a0h of weigh-in). 11. Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are utilized to recover lost body fluid/mass before competition with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage. 12. Oral rehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with a sodium range of 50-90\u2009mmol/dL should take precedence immediately post-weigh-in. 13. Fast-acting carbohydrates at a tolerable rate of\u2009\u2264\u200960 g/h should follow oral rehydration solutions. Post weigh-in intake of fiber should be limited to avoid gastrointestinal distress. 14. Post-weigh-in carbohydrate intake at 8-12\u2009g/kg may be appropriate for combat athletes that undertook significant glycogen depletion strategies during fight week. About 4-7\u2009g/kg may be suitable for modest carbohydrate restriction. 15. Post weigh-in, rehydration/refueling protocols should aim to regain\u2009\u226510% of body mass to mitigate declines in performance and the negative effects of rapid weight loss. 16. The long-term effects of frequent weight cuts on health and performance are unknown, necessitating further research.",

          "content": "Increasing nitric oxide bioavailability may induce physiological effects that enhance endurance exercise performance. This review sought to evaluate the performance effects of consuming foods containing compounds that may promote nitric oxide bioavailability. Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, EMBASE and SportDiscus were searched, with included studies assessing endurance performance following consumption of foods containing nitrate, L-arginine, L-citrulline or polyphenols. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted, with subgroup analyses performed based on food sources, sex, fitness, performance test type and supplementation protocol (e.g. duration). One hundred and eighteen studies were included in the meta-analysis, which encompassed 59 polyphenol studies, 56 nitrate studies and three L-citrulline studies. No effect on exercise performance following consumption of foods rich in L-citrulline was identified (SMD=-0.03, p=0.24). Trivial but significant benefits were demonstrated for consumption of nitrate and polyphenol-rich foods (SMD=0.15 and 0.17, respectively, p<0.001), including performance in time-trial, time-to-exhaustion and intermittent-type tests, and following both acute and multiple-day supplementation, but no effect of nitrate or polyphenol consumption was found in females. Among nitrate-rich foods, beneficial effects were seen for beetroot, but not red spinach or Swiss chard and rhubarb. For polyphenol-rich foods, benefits were found for grape, (nitrate-depleted) beetroot, French maritime pine, Montmorency cherry and pomegranate, while no significant effects were evident for New Zealand blackcurrant, cocoa, ginseng, green tea or raisins. Considerable heterogeneity between polyphenol studies may reflect food-specific effects or differences in study designs and subject characteristics. Well-trained males (V\u0307O \u226565 ml.kg.min) exhibited small, significant benefits following polyphenol, but not nitrate consumption. Foods rich in polyphenols and nitrate provide trivial benefits for endurance exercise performance, although these effects may be food dependent. Highly trained endurance athletes do not appear to benefit from consuming nitrate-rich foods but may benefit from polyphenol consumption. Further research into food sources, dosage and supplementation duration to optimise the ergogenic response to polyphenol consumption is warranted. Further studies should evaluate whether differential sex-based responses to nitrate and polyphenol consumption are attributable to physiological differences or sample size limitations. The review protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/u7nsj ) and no funding was provided.",

          "content": "Athletes often use sport supplements to improve their physical and physiological performance. This randomized, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of combined versus single supplementation of creatine (Cr), beta-alanine (BA), and L-citrulline (L-Cit) during short sprint interval training (SSIT)\u00a0on basketball players' physical and physiological performance over a period of 28\u00a0days. Forty-eight basketball players were equally assigned to 6 groups of Cr (0.1\u00a0g/kg of Cr monohydrate daily), BA (4.8\u00a0g daily), L-Cit (6\u00a0g daily), combined supplementation, PL, and an active control group, and each group consisted of 8 participants. The training groups participated in SSIT (3 sets of 10 repetitions of 5-s all-out runs) sessions 3 times a week for 4\u00a0weeks. Physical (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Illinois change of direction) and physiological (Wingate anaerobic power and cardiorespiratory fitness test) performance were evaluated before and after the training period. All training groups (Cr, BA, L-Cit, combined, and PL) showed significant improvements in physical and physiological performance over the 4-week intervention (P < .05). Interestingly, the supplement groups displayed significantly (P = .001) greater changes than the PL group, indicating better outcomes in performance adaptations. However, significant differences in performance variables were observed among the supplement groups. Our findings indicate that short-term supplementation with Cr, BA, and L-Cit, as well as a combination of them during SSIT, can significantly improve the physical and physiological performance of basketball players compared to a PL.",

          "content": "Given the increasing popularity of CrossFit as a high-intensity functional training program and the potential benefits of citrulline malate (CM) in enhancing exercise performance through its role as a precursor to L-arginine and nitric oxide production, this study aimed to investigate the acute effects of CM supplementation on CrossFit performance and cardiovascular function. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, 21 recreationally active participants (mean age 22.2 \u00b1 2.6 years, mean body weight 75.9 \u00b1 10.4 kg) with CrossFit experience completed the \"Cindy\" workout under CM and placebo conditions. Participants consumed 4.4 g of CM or a placebo 60 min before the workout, and the performance was measured by the number of rounds completed. Secondary outcomes included heart rate response, time spent in different heart rate intensity zones, and post-exercise recovery time. The results indicated no significant difference in the number of rounds completed between the CM and placebo conditions (13.5 \u00b1 5.2 vs. 13.8 \u00b1 6.7 rounds, respectively;  = 0.587). However, the time spent in zone 4 (80-90% of HR max) was significantly increased in the CM condition (527 \u00b1 395 s vs. 453 \u00b1 334 s;  = 0.017), suggesting a potential benefit for aerobic capacity and anaerobic threshold. No significant differences in post-exercise recovery time were observed (6.6 \u00b1 4.7 h vs. 6.9 \u00b1 4.7 h;  = 0.475). This study highlights the need for further research with larger sample sizes, both genders, and different CM dosages to clarify these findings and better understand CM's role in enhancing athletic performance.",

          "title": "Acute Effect of Citrulline Malate on Repetition Performance During Strength Training: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
          "content": "Citrulline malate (CitMal) is a dietary supplement that is suggested to enhance strength training performance. However, there is conflicting evidence on this matter. Thus, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine whether supplementing with CitMal prior to strength training could increase the total number of repetitions performed before reaching voluntary muscular failure. A systematic search was conducted wherein the inclusion criteria were double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in healthy participants that examined the effect of CitMal on repetitions to failure during upper body and lower body resistance exercises. The Hedges's g standardized mean differences (SMD) between the placebo and CitMal trials were calculated and used in a random effect model. Two separate subanalyses were performed for upper body and lower body exercises. Eight studies, including 137 participants who consisted of strength-trained men (n = 101) and women (n = 26) in addition to untrained men (n = 9), fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Across the studies, 14 single-joint and multijoint exercises were performed with an average of 51 \u00b1 23 total repetitions during 5 \u00b1 3 sets per exercise at \u223c70% of one-repetition maximum. Supplementing with 6-8 g of CitMal 40-60\u00a0min before exercise increased repetitions by 3 \u00b1 5 (6.4 \u00b1 7.9%) compared with placebo (p = .022) with a small SMD (0.196). The subanalysis for the lower body resulted in a tendency for an effect of the supplement (8.1 \u00b1 8.4%, SMD: 0.27, p = .051) with no significant effect for the upper body (5.7 \u00b1 8.4%, SMD: 0.16, p = .131). The current analysis observed a small ergogenic effect of CitMal compared with placebo. Acute CitMal supplementation may, therefore, delay fatigue and enhance muscle endurance during high-intensity strength training.",

          "content": "The global market for nutritional supplements (NS) is growing rapidly, and the use of L-arginine (Arg), L-citrulline (Cit), and citrulline malate (CitMal) supplements has been shown to enhance cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Over the past decade, Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements have received considerable attention from researchers in the field of exercise nutrition, who have investigated their potential effects on hemodynamic function, endothelial function, aerobic and anaerobic capacity, strength, power, and endurance. Previous studies were reviewed to determine the potential impact of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and exercise performance. By synthesizing the existing literature, the study aimed to provide insight into the possible uses and limitations of these supplements for these purposes. The results showed that both recreational and trained athletes did not see improved physical performance or increased nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with 0.075 g or 6 g doses of Arg supplement per body weight. However, 2.4 to 6 g of Cit per day for 7 to 16 days of various NSs had a positive impact, increasing NO synthesis, enhancing athletic performance indicators, and reducing feelings of exertion. The effects of an 8 g acute dose of CitMal supplement were inconsistent, and more research is needed to determine its impact on muscle endurance performance. Based on the positive effects reported in previous studies, further testing is warranted in various populations that may benefit from nutritional supplements, including aerobic and anaerobic athletes, resistance-trained individuals, elderly people, and clinical populations, to determine the impact of different doses, timing of ingestion, and long-term and acute effects of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and athletic performance.",

Global positioning system (GPS)-derived external load was recorded throughout the intervention. Performance tests-a countermovement jump (CMJ) test and the Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT)-and blood sampling for plasma NO and nitrite (NO) concentrations were conducted at baseline and the day after a competitive match. : The supplementation with NIT + CM increased maximal speed (Vmax) throughout training and match play. During post-match testing, the NIT + CM group exhibited a significantly smaller decline in mean (P) and minimum (P) power during the WAnT, along with reduced power loss in both the first (0-15 s) and second (15-30 s) intervals. Plasma NO concentrations significantly increased from baseline in the NIT + CM group and remained elevated 24 h after the final dose, confirming sustained systemic exposure. : Chronic NIT + CM supplementation may enhance Vmax and help preserve anaerobic performance the day after a match.

Supplements were ingested 60\u00a0min before performing a countermovement jump (CMJ) test (outcomes included jump height, rate of force development, peak force, and peak power), one-repetition maximum (1RM) squat and bench press, and repetitions to muscular failure in the squat and bench press with 60% of 1RM. Pain perception was evaluated following the repetitions to failure tests. The study was registered at ISRCTN (registration number: ISRCTN11694009). Compared to the placebo condition, isolated caffeine ingestion and co-ingestion of caffeine and CitMal significantly enhanced strength in 1RM bench press (Cohen's d: 0.05-0.06; 2.5-2.7%), muscular endurance in the squat (d: 0.46-0.58; 18.6-18.7%) and bench press (d: 0.48-0.64; 9.3-9.5%). However, there was no significant difference between isolated caffeine ingestion and caffeine co-ingested with CitMal, and isolated CitMal supplementation did not have an ergogenic effect in any outcome. No main effect of condition was found in the analysis for CMJ-derived variables, 1RM squat and pain perception. Caffeine ingestion appears to be ergogenic for muscular strength and muscular endurance, while adding CitMal does not seem to further enhance these effects.",

CMJ jumping test results showed no between-condition differences, and blood samples were consistent (P\u2009>\u20090.200). Supplementation with 3.5\u00a0g of BR extract plus 6\u00a0g of CIT for 7\u00a0days improved lactate clearance after Wingate test and peak power in a performance test.

J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1480-1495, 2020-L-citrulline, a nonessential amino acid found primarily in watermelon, has recently garnered much attention for its potential to augment L-arginine bioavailability, nitric oxide production, and exercise performance. Over the past decade, L-citrulline has received considerable scientific attention examining potentially ergogenic properties for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance. Thus, the purpose of this article is to summarize the theoretical rationale behind L-citrulline supplementation and to comprehensively review the available scientific evidence assessing the potential ergogenic value of L-citrulline supplementation on vascular function and exercise performance in humans. In addition, research that has investigated the potential synergistic effects of L-citrulline with other dietary ingredients (e.g., arginine, antioxidants, nitrates, and branched-chain amino acids) is reviewed. Oral L-citrulline and citrulline malate supplementation have shown to increase plasma citrulline and arginine concentrations, along with total nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Although blood flow enhancement is a proposed mechanism for the ergogenic potential of L-citrulline, evidence supporting acute improvements in vasodilation and skeletal muscle tissue perfusion after supplementation is scarce and inconsistent. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that L-citrulline supplementation can enhance exercise performance and recovery. Given the positive effects observed from some investigations, future studies should continue to investigate the effects of both acute and chronic supplementation with L-citrulline and citrulline malate on markers of blood flow and exercise performance and should seek to elucidate the mechanism underlying such effects.",

          "content": "Physical activity and nutrition play important roles in preventing adverse health outcomes that accompany aging. It has been shown that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) combined with citrulline (CIT) supplementation can improve physical and functional capacities. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum metabolites following a 12-week HIIT combined or not with CIT in obese older adults, and to correlate the metabolic changes with clinico-biological parameters changes. Eighty-six obese older adults completed a 12-week HIIT program combined with a 10\u2005g daily supplementation of either CIT or placebo (PLA) during a double-blinded randomized interventional trial. Only participants with blood samples at T0 (before the intervention) and/or T12 (after the intervention) were included in our sub-analysis (HIIT-PLA-T0: n\u2009=\u200944 and HIIT-PLA-T12: n\u2009=\u200928; HIIT-CIT-T0: n\u2009=\u200939 and HIIT-CIT-T12: n\u2009=\u200942). Serum samples were analyzed by different liquid or gas phase chromatography methods coupled to mass spectrometry. Among the identified metabolites, 44 changed significantly following the 12-week intervention (Time effect), and 10 of them were more affected when HIIT was combined with CIT (Time\u2009Supp effect). Arginine increased significantly due to the 12-week intervention. Correlation analyses demonstrated that decreased triglyceride (TG) (16:1/18:1/16:0) and aspartic acid significantly correlated with a reduction of adiposity-related parameters (fat mass, leg lean mass, leptin, total triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein). Arginine, TG (16:1/18:1/16:0) and aspartic acid might constitute biomarkers of cardiometabolic health and adiposity. Further studies are needed to confirm these associations and understand the underlying mechanisms. A 12-week intervention involving high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with or without citrulline (CIT) supplementation induced adaptations in the serum metabolome of obese older adults through significant changes in 44 metabolites.Changes in 23 metabolites were observed when a CIT supplementation was administered along with a 12-week HIIT intervention.TG (16:1/18:1/16:0) correlated with several adiposity parameters including leptin, triglycerides, legs lean mass.Aspartic acid correlated with several adiposity parameters including leptin, LDL cholesterol as well as android, arms and trunk fat mass.",

          "content": "Citrulline is a popular dietary supplement, primarily thought to exert ergogenic effects on exercise performance through the enhancement of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and ammonia buffering. However, recent findings surrounding citrulline's effect on endurance performance have been inconsistent. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature have yet to be undertaken. To determine if acute ingestion of citrulline has an ergogenic effect on endurance performance in young healthy adults. A systematic search of three databases was undertaken to find peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English investigating the effects of citrulline supplementation on endurance performance in young healthy adults. Two independent investigators completed a three-phased screening procedure against pre-determined eligibility criteria. Included studies evaluated loading or bolus dosage regimes of citrulline in participants aged 18 or over that were at least recreationally active. Outcome measures focused on time-to-completion (TTC) or time-to-exhaustion (TTE) in continuous submaximal intensity exercise. Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed-effects model to pool the weighted estimate of standardized mean differences (SMD) across studies. A chi-squared test assessed heterogeneity between studies. This review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Nine studies (\u2009=\u2009158 participants) met the eligibility criteria; five reported TTE outcomes (I\u2009=\u20090%, \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.37, df\u2009=\u20094, \u2009=\u20090.99) and four reported TTC outcomes (I\u2009=\u20090%, \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.46, df\u2009=\u20093, \u2009=\u20090.93), both with a low between-study heterogeneity. The results of the meta-analyses showed no significant difference in the endurance performance measures, TTE (pooled SMD\u2009=\u20090.03 [-0.27, 0.33]) and TTC (pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.07 [-0.50, 0.15]), after acute ingestion of citrulline supplementation or a control in young healthy adults. The current evidence suggests no significant benefit of citrulline supplementation for endurance performance. However, the small evidence base requires further research to fully evaluate this topic. Recommendations include a focus on female populations; higher continuous doses of citrulline over seven days; and TTC outcome measures over longer distances to simulate competition.",

          "content": "Use of supplements to aid performance is common practice amongst recreationally active individuals, including those without a sufficient evidence base. This investigation sought to assess whether acute supplementation with 8\u00a0g of citrulline malate (CM) (1.11: 1 ratio) would improve anaerobic performance. A randomised double blind placebo control trial was employed, using a counterbalanced design. We recruited recreationally active men and women to take part in an isokinetic chair protocol, based on German Volume Training (GVT) whereby participants attempted to perform 10 sets of 10 repetitions against a force representing 70% of their peak concentric force. The number of repetitions achieved over the course of the GVT was 94.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 and 90.9\u2009\u00b1\u200913.9 for placebo and CM respectively. There was no significant difference between the placebo and CM treatment for number of repetitions (P\u2009=\u20090.33), isometric (P\u2009=\u20090.60), concentric (P\u2009=\u20090.38), or eccentric (P\u2009=\u20090.65) peak force following the GVT. Total muscle soreness was significantly higher in the CM compared to the placebo treatment following the GVT protocol over 72\u00a0h (P\u2009=\u20090.01); although this was not accompanied by a greater workload/number of repetitions in the CM group. We conclude that an acute dose of CM does not significantly affect anaerobic performance using an isokinetic chair in recreational active participants. Practical implications include precaution in recommending CM supplementation. Coaches and athletes should be aware of the disparity between the chemical analyses of the products reviewed in the present investigation versus the manufacturers' claims.",

Data analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4.1 software, employing a random effects model to statistically analyze the pooled effect sizes of the obtained systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) data. Results are reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). A total of 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of l-citrulline supplementation and watermelon intake on BP in middle-aged and elderly individuals were included, comprising 24 datasets involving 415 participants. The results indicate that l-citrulline supplementation and watermelon intake significantly reduced SBP (-4.02 mmHg [95 % CI: -6.54 to -1.50], P = 0.002) and DBP (-2.54 mmHg [95 % CI: -4.27 to -0.81], P = 0.004) in the elderly. Subgroup analysis showed that the combined supplementation of l-citrulline and l-arginine significantly decreased SBP (-10.44 mmHg [95 % CI: -13.57 to -7.31], P < 0.00001) and DBP (-4.86 mmHg [95 % CI: -7.93 to -1.79], P = 0.002) in this population. l-citrulline supplementation and watermelon intake overall lowered BP in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Subgroup analysis indicates that the combined supplementation of l-citrulline and l-arginine is superior to l-citrulline or watermelon supplementation alone. These findings provide new dietary recommendations for BP management in the elderly, suggesting that dietary interventions can effectively improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).",

          "content": "This study compared the acute and chronic impact of citrulline malate (CM) supplementation on muscle contractile properties and fatigue rate of the quadriceps. Eighteen recreationally trained males consumed both a placebo (PL) and CM treatment for two separate dosing periods. The first experimental testing session for each dosing period was considered the baseline day, the second session the acute day, and the third session the chronic day, which followed seven consecutive days of supplementation. All testing sessions included exercising on a cycle ergometer at 50%-60% of their max power output for 30\u00a0min followed by performing the Thorstensson test on an isokinetic dynamometer. A two-way (Supplement \u00d7 Time) analysis of variance with repeated measures resulted in no significant interactions (p > .05) (PL: baseline day, acute day, chronic day vs. CM: baseline day, acute day, chronic day) for peak power (in watts) (469 \u00b1 81, 490 \u00b1 97, 502 \u00b1 99 vs. 464 \u00b1 85, 480 \u00b1 103, 501 \u00b1 81); peak torque (in newton meters) (150 \u00b1 26, 157 \u00b1 32, 161 \u00b1 31 vs. 149 \u00b1 27, 156 \u00b1 33, 161 \u00b1 26); fatigue rate (in percentage) (57 \u00b1 9, 57 \u00b1 10, 58 \u00b1 9 vs. 57 \u00b1 10, 56 \u00b1 9, 58 \u00b1 9); and heart rate (in beats per minute) (156 \u00b1 17, 146 \u00b1 13, 146 \u00b1 9 vs. 155 \u00b1 11, 146 \u00b1 11, 146 \u00b1 9).

J Strength Cond Res 36(12): 3562-3570, 2022-This systematic review examines the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation (SUP) on muscle strength and hypertrophy when combined with physical exercise. The databases PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE were searched for full-text articles published between January 2000 and June 2020. For inclusion, studies had to report on the effects of SUP administered as acute or chronic doses together with a standardized exercise protocol on muscle strength and hypertrophy compared with placebo in healthy adults who were sedentary, physically active, or professional athletes. Twelve studies (1,571 subjects) were finally selected. In 5 studies, the SUP regime was acute, and in 7, it was chronic. SUP was nitrate-rich beetroot juice in 9 studies, a potassium nitrate capsule in 1, and increased dietary nitrate in 2. Ingested nitrate was 64-1,200 mg. Of the 12 studies, 6 observed an ergogenic effect of SUP compared with placebo. These findings indicate that muscle strength gains are possible provided the dose, format, frequency, period, and exercise test are appropriate. Best results were observed with a minimum acute dose of 400 mg of nitrate provided as beetroot juice/shot taken 2-2.5 hours before exercise involving low- and high-intensity muscle contractions. This SUP regime seems to improve muscle efficiency in terms of reduced phosphocreatine and energy costs (P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and improved time to exhaustion.",

          "content": "Dietary nitrate supplementation can enhance exercise performance in healthy people, but it is not clear if it is beneficial in COPD. We investigated the hypotheses that acute nitrate dosing would improve exercise performance and reduce the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise in people with COPD. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over single dose study. Subjects were randomised to consume either nitrate-rich beetroot juice (containing 12.9 mmoles nitrate) or placebo (nitrate-depleted beetroot juice) 3 hours prior to endurance cycle ergometry, performed at 70% of maximal workload assessed by a prior incremental exercise test. After a minimum washout period of 7 days the protocol was repeated with the crossover beverage. 21 subjects successfully completed the study (age 68 \u00b1 7 years; BMI 25.2 \u00b1 5.5 kg/m2; FEV1 percentage predicted 50.1 \u00b1 21.6%; peak VO2 18.0 \u00b1 5.9 ml/min/kg). Resting diastolic blood pressure fell significantly with nitrate supplementation compared to placebo (-7 \u00b1 8 mmHg nitrate vs. -1 \u00b1 8 mmHg placebo; p = 0.008). Median endurance time did not differ significantly; nitrate 5.65 (3.90-10.40) minutes vs. placebo 6.40 (4.01-9.67) minutes (p = 0.50). However, isotime oxygen consumption (VO2) was lower following nitrate supplementation (16.6 \u00b1 6.0 ml/min/kg nitrate vs. 17.2 \u00b1 6.0 ml/min/kg placebo; p = 0.043), and consequently nitrate supplementation caused a significant lowering of the amplitude of the VO2-percentage isotime curve. Acute administration of oral nitrate did not enhance endurance exercise performance; however the observation that beetroot juice caused reduced oxygen consumption at isotime suggests that further investigation of this treatment approach is warranted, perhaps targeting a more hypoxic phenotype.

Participants performed an endurance shuttle walk test, using their prescribed oxygen, 3\u2009hours after consuming either 140\u2009mL of nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BRJ) (12.9\u2009mmol nitrate) or placebo (nitrate-depleted BRJ).

          "content": "The purpose of this review was to examine the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance by systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled human studies. A search of four electronic databases and cross-referencing found 17 studies investigating the effect of inorganic nitrate supplementation on exercise performance that met the inclusion criteria. Beetroot juice and sodium nitrate were the most common supplements, with doses ranging from 300 to 600 mg nitrate and prescribed in a manner ranging from a single bolus to 15 days of regular ingestion. Pooled analysis showed a significant moderate benefit (ES = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.23-1.35) of nitrate supplementation on performance for time to exhaustion tests (p = .006). There was a small but insignificant beneficial effect on performance for time trials (ES = 0.11, 95% CI: -0.16-0.37) and graded exercise tests (ES = 0.26, 95% CI: -0.10-0.62). Qualitative analysis suggested that performance benefits are more often observed in inactive to recreationally active individuals and when a chronic loading of nitrate over several days is undertaken. Overall, these results suggest that nitrate supplementation is associated with a moderate improvement in constant load time to exhaustion tasks. Despite not reaching statistical significance, the small positive effect on time trial or graded exercise performance may be meaningful in an elite sport context. More data are required to clarify the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance and to elucidate the optimal way to implement supplementation.",

          "content": "Oral inorganic nitrate (NO) supplementation has been shown to increase bioavailable NO and provide potential ergogenic benefits in males; however, data in females is scarce. Estrogen is known to increase endogenous NO bioavailability and to fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle (MC), being lowest in the early follicular (EF) phase and highest during the late follicular (LF) phase. This study examined the effects of oral NO supplementation on exercise economy, endurance capacity, and vascular health in young females across the MC. Ten normally menstruating females' MCs were tested in a double-blinded, randomized design during both the EF and LF phases of the MC. Participants consumed \u223c13 mmol NO, in the form of 140 mL beetroot juice (BRJ) or an identical NO-depleted placebo (PL) for \u223c3 days before lab visits and 2 h before testing on lab visits. Plasma nitrate, nitrite, and estradiol were assessed, as was blood pressure and pulse wave velocity. Moderate-intensity exercise economy and severe intensity time to exhaustion (TTE) were tested on a cycle ergometer. As expected, plasma estradiol was elevated in the LF phase, and plasma nitrite and nitrate were elevated in the BRJ condition. Exercise economy was unaltered by BRJ or the MC, however TTE was significantly worsened by 48 s (\u223c10%) after BRJ supplementation ( = 0.04), but was not different across the MC with no interaction effects. In conclusion, NO supplementation did not affect exercise economy or vascular health and worsened aerobic endurance capacity (TTE), suggesting healthy females should proceed with caution when considering supplementation with BRJ. Although inorganic nitrate (NO) supplementation has increased in popularity as a means of improving exercise performance, data in females at different phases of the menstrual cycle are lacking despite known interactions of estrogen with NO. This study revealed neither NO supplementation nor the menstrual cycle influenced exercise economy or vascular health in healthy young naturally menstruating females, while NO supplementation significantly worsened endurance capacity (10%) independent of the menstrual cycle phase.",

          "content": "Dietary nitrate supplementation has been shown to decrease the oxygen cost of exercise and prolong exercise tolerance, as measured by sub-maximal exercise endurance distance and time at 85% V\u0307O2max, in both elite athletes and normal healthy subjects. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have reduced quality of life and ability to perform activities of daily living attributable to diminished exercise tolerance, and dietary nitrate may be able to ameliorate this. We performed a double-blind, computer-randomized placebo control crossover trial at a tertiary Australian hospital to investigate whether dietary nitrate supplementation as beetroot juice (BR) would augment submaximal exercise endurance in individuals with spirometrically confirmed stable moderate COPD. Volunteers underwent an incremental shuttle walk test to determine V\u0307O2max followed by a test dose of BR to establish safety in the study population. Participants performed an endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) at 85% V\u0307O2max after randomization to either a 3 day wash-in of BR (4.8 mmol twice a day) or placebo (nitrate deplete BR), with a final dose on the morning of testing. They then crossed over after 4 day washout. Repeated measures two sided paired t-tests were employed. 35 participants were recruited with 19 completing the trial. In the initial safety phase, we measured systolic blood pressure over four hours post first dose of BR, and found a mean 10 mmHg decrement maximal at 1 hour. One individual developed symptomatic postural hypotension and was excluded. The primary outcomes of ESWT distance and time to fatigue improved by 11% and 6% respectively; however these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.494 and 0.693 respectively).

We hypothesized that, independent of antihypertensive medication status, dietary nitrate supplementation would increase limb blood flow, decrease mean arterial pressure (MAP), and increase limb vascular conductance during exercise in patients with hypertension. Patients with hypertension either abstained from ( = 14, Off-Meds) or continued ( = 12, On-Meds) antihypertensive medications. Within each group, patients consumed (crossover design) nitrate-rich or nitrate-depleted (placebo) beetroot juice for 3 days before performing handgrip (HG) and knee-extensor exercise (KE). Blood flow and MAP were measured using Doppler ultrasound and an automated monitor, respectively. Dietary nitrate increased plasma-[nitrite] Off-Meds and On-Meds. There were no significant effects of dietary nitrate on blood flow, MAP, or vascular conductance during HG in Off-Meds or On-Meds. For KE, dietary nitrate decreased MAP (means \u00b1 SD across all 3 exercise intensities, 118\u2009\u00b1\u200914 vs. 122\u2009\u00b1\u200914 mmHg,  = 0.024) and increased vascular conductance (26.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 vs. 24.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.0 mL/min/mmHg,  = 0.024), but did not affect blood flow for Off-Meds, with no effects On-Meds. Dietary nitrate-induced changes in blood flow ( = -0.67,  < 0.001), MAP ( = -0.43,  = 0.009), and vascular conductance ( = -0.64,  < 0.001) during KE, but only vascular conductance ( = -0.35,  = 0.039) during HG, were significantly related to the magnitude of placebo values, with no differentiation between groups. Thus, the effects of dietary nitrate on limb hemodynamics and MAP during exercise in patients with hypertension are dependent on the values at baseline, independent of antihypertensive medication status, and dependent on whether exercise was performed by the forearm or quadriceps. Adverse hemodynamic responses to exercise in patients with hypertension, despite antihypertensive medication, indicate a sustained cardiovascular risk. The efficacy of dietary nitrate to improve limb vascular conductance during exercise was inversely dependent on the magnitude of exercising limb vascular conductance at baseline, rather than antihypertensive medication status. The effects of dietary nitrate on hemodynamics during exercise in patients with hypertension are dependent on the values at baseline and independent of antihypertensive medication status.",

However, nitrate may exacerbate acute mountain sickness (AMS), specifically headache. This study investigated the effect of nitrate supplementation on AMS symptoms and exercise responses with 6-h hypoxia. Twenty recreationally active men [age, 22 \u00b1 4 yr, maximal oxygen consumption (V\u0307o), 51 \u00b1 6 ml\u00b7min\u00b7kg, means \u00b1 SD] completed this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study. Twelve participants were classified as AMS- on the basis of Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire [Acute Cerebral Mountain Sickness score (AMS-C)] <0.7 in both trials, and five participants were classified as AMS+ on the basis of AMS-C \u22650.7 on placebo. Five days of nitrate supplementation (70-ml beetroot juice containing ~6.4 mmol nitrate daily) increased plasma NO metabolites by 182 \u00b5M compared with placebo but did not reduce AMS or improve exercise performance. After 4-h hypoxia [inspired O fraction ([Formula: see text])\u2009=\u20090.124], nitrate increased AMS-C and headache severity (visual analog scale; whole sample \u220610 [1, 20] mm, mean difference [95% confidence interval];  = 0.03) compared with placebo. In addition, after 5-h hypoxia, nitrate increased sense of effort during submaximal exercise (\u22067 [-1, 14];  = 0.07). In AMS-, nitrate did not alter headache or sense of effort. In contrast, in AMS+, nitrate increased headache severity (\u220626 [-3, 56] mm;  = 0.07), sense of effort (\u220614 [1, 28];  = 0.04), oxygen consumption, ventilation, and mean arterial pressure during submaximal exercise. On the next day, in a separate acute hypoxic exercise test ([Formula: see text]\u2009=\u20090.141), nitrate did not improve time to exhaustion at 80% hypoxic V\u0307o In conclusion, dietary nitrate increases AMS and sense of effort during exercise, particularly in those who experience AMS. Dietary nitrate is therefore not recommended as an AMS prophylactic or ergogenic aid in nonacclimatized individuals at altitude. This is the first study to identify that the popular dietary nitrate supplement (beetroot) does not reduce acute mountain sickness (AMS) or improve exercise performance during 6-h hypoxia. The consumption of nitrate in those susceptible to AMS exacerbates AMS symptoms (headache) and sense of effort and raises oxygen cost, ventilation, and blood pressure during walking exercise in 6-h hypoxia. These data question the suitability of nitrate supplementation during altitude travel in nonacclimatized people.",

          "content": "Cold exposure increases blood pressure (BP) and salivary flow rate (SFR). Increased cold-induced SFR would be hypothesized to enhance oral nitrate delivery for reduction to nitrite by oral anaerobes and to subsequently elevate plasma [nitrite] and nitric oxide bioavailability. We tested the hypothesis that dietary nitrate supplementation would increase plasma [nitrite] and lower BP to a greater extent in cool compared with normothermic conditions. Twelve males attended the laboratory on four occasions. Baseline measurements were completed at 28\u00b0C. Subsequently, participants ingested 140 mL of concentrated nitrate-rich (BR; \u223c13 mmol nitrate) or nitrate-depleted (PL) beetroot juice. Measurements were repeated over 3 h at either 28\u00b0C (Norm) or 20\u00b0C (Cool). Mean skin temperature was lowered compared with baseline in PL-Cool and BR-Cool. SFR was greater in BR-Norm, PL-Cool, and BR-Cool than PL-Norm. Plasma [nitrite] at 3 h was higher in BR-Cool (592\u2009\u00b1\u2009239 nM) versus BR-Norm (410\u2009\u00b1\u2009195 nM). Systolic BP (SBP) at 3 h was not different between PL-Norm (117\u2009\u00b1\u20096 mmHg) and BR-Norm (113\u2009\u00b1\u20099 mmHg). SBP increased above baseline at 1, 2, and 3 h in PL-Cool but not BR-Cool. These results suggest that BR consumption is more effective at increasing plasma [nitrite] in cool compared with normothermic conditions and blunts the rise in BP following acute cool air exposure, which might have implications for attenuating the increased cardiovascular strain in the cold. Compared with normothermic conditions, acute nitrate ingestion increased plasma [nitrite], a substrate for oxygen-independent nitric oxide generation, to a greater extent during cool air exposure. Systolic blood pressure was increased during cool air exposure in the placebo condition with this cool-induced blood pressure increase attenuated after acute nitrate ingestion. These findings improve our understanding of environmental factors that influence nitrate metabolism and the efficacy of nitrate supplementation to lower blood pressure.",

Eleven recreationally active male participants (27\u2009\u00b1\u20095 yr, V\u0307o: 42\u2009\u00b1\u20092 mL/kg/min) performed two experimental trials following 3 days of either dietary nitrate-rich beetroot juice (4.1 mmol NO/day; DNS) or placebo (PLA) supplementation in a blinded, counterbalanced order. Exercise consisted of constant-load cycling at 50, 75, and 100 W (4 min each) and, at \u223c80% of peak power output (218\u2009\u00b1\u200912 W), to task-failure. All participants returned to repeat the shorter of the two trials performed to task failure, but with the opposite supplementation regime (iso-time comparison; ISO). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), leg blood flow (Q; Doppler ultrasound), leg vascular conductance (LVC), and pulmonary gas exchange were continuously assessed during exercise. Locomotor muscle fatigue was determined by the change in pre to postexercise quadriceps twitch-torque (\u0394Q) and voluntary activation (\u0394VA; electrical femoral nerve stimulation). Following DNS, plasma [nitrite] (\u223c670 vs. \u223c180 nmol) and [nitrate] (\u223c775 vs. \u223c11 \u03bcmol) were significantly elevated compared with PLA. Unlike PLA, DNS lowered both Q and MAP by \u223c8% ( < 0.05), but did not alter LVC ( = 0.31). V\u0307O across work rates, as well as cycling time to task-failure (\u223c7 min) and locomotor muscle fatigue following the ISO-time comparison were not different between the two conditions (\u0394Q \u223c42%, \u0394VA \u223c4%). Thus, despite significant hemodynamic changes, DNS did not alter the development of locomotor muscle fatigue and, ultimately, cycling time to task failure. This study sought to characterize the impact of dietary nitrate supplementation on the hemodynamic response, locomotor muscle fatigue, and time to task failure during cycling exercise. Although nitrate supplementation lowered mean arterial pressure and exercising leg blood flow, leg vascular conductance and oxygen utilization were unaffected. Despite significant hemodynamic changes, there was no effect of dietary nitrate on neuromuscular fatigue development and, ultimately, cycling time to task failure.",

J Strength Cond Res 32(6): 1796-1808, 2018-The purpose of this article was to systematically review the current literature and evaluate the overall efficacy of nitrate supplementation on exercise tolerance and performance by meta-analysis. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) were an experimental trial published in an English peer-reviewed journal; (b) compared the effects of inorganic nitrate consumption with a non-bioactive supplement control or placebo; (c) used a quantifiable measure of exercise performance; and (d) was carried out in apparently healthy participants without disease. A total of 29 studies were identified that investigated the effects of nitrate supplementation on exercise tolerance or performance in accordance with the criteria outlined. Analysis using time to exhaustion as the outcome variable revealed a significant effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise tolerance (ES = 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.47; p = 0.006) compared with placebo. Analysis using time to complete a specific distance as the outcome variable revealed no significant effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance (ES = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.28 to 0.17; p = 0.64) compared with placebo. Nitrate supplementation is likely to improve exercise tolerance and capacity that may improve exercise performance. More research is required to determine the optimal dose and duration of nitrate supplementation. It would also be important to consider the type of athlete performing the exercise and the duration, intensity, and mode of the exercise performed because these factors are likely to influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation.",

Therefore, the present double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the effects of [Formula: see text] supplementation on isokinetic peak power, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) force, muscular endurance (time-to-task failure; TTF), and recovery from fatigue in young females ( = 12) and males ( = 14). Participants consumed \u223c13 mmol [Formula: see text] [beetroot juice (BRJ)], or an identical [Formula: see text]-depleted beverage placebo (PL), for \u223c3 days and 2 h before testing visits. Plasma nitrate and nitrite were elevated in the BRJ condition ( \u2264 0.05). Peak power (W\u00b7kg) showed a sex effect ( \u2264 0.05) at all angular velocities and a sex-by-treatment effect at 270 and 360\u00b0/s ( \u2264 0.05).

Cohen's  effect sizes for peak power showed moderate to large effect sizes at 270 ( = 0.92) and 360\u00b0/s ( = 0.81), showing a possible differentiated effect of dietary nitrate in females and males. The present data indicate that [Formula: see text] supplementation does not significantly affect knee extensor maximal power, maximal contraction velocity, and muscular endurance in either sex. The sex-dependent response to dietary nitrate supplementation requires further investigation as data on females is scarce. Recent data have suggested that inorganic nitrate ([Formula: see text]) supplementation may benefit males; however, females may experience worsened endurance capacity. This study revealed a potential differentiated effect of [Formula: see text] supplementation on outcomes of muscle contractile function between healthy, young males and females.

Estrogen increases NO bioavailability and fluctuates throughout the menstrual cycle, with low levels in the early follicular (EF) phase and peaking during the late follicular (LF) phase. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of [Formula: see text] supplementation on isokinetic peak power, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) force, muscular endurance, and recovery from fatigue in healthy young females during the EF and LF phases of the menstrual cycle. Ten eumenorrheic females were tested in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled design.

Plasma estradiol was elevated in the LF phase, and plasma nitrite and nitrate were elevated in the BRJ condition ( < 0.05). Although isokinetic peak power was unchanged, calculated maximal power (Pmax) and maximal velocity (Vmax) were significantly worsened in the BRJ treatment independent of the menstrual cycle phase ( = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). Muscular endurance, MVIC, and fatigue recovery were unaltered by BRJ or the menstrual cycle. These data indicate that [Formula: see text] supplementation decreased maximal power and velocity in females and suggest that the benefits of [Formula: see text] supplementation previously found in males may not extend to young females. Recent data have suggested that inorganic nitrate ([Formula: see text]) supplementation may benefit males, however, females may experience worsened endurance capacity independent of menstrual cycle phase. This study revealed neither [Formula: see text] supplementation nor the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle influenced maximal isometric voluntary contraction or endurance capacity in healthy, young, naturally menstruating females, whereas [Formula: see text] supplementation significantly worsened estimated peak power (Pmax) and velocity (Vmax) independent of the menstrual cycle phase.",

In this SRMA, human experimental trials, controlled with a placebo group, assessing the effect of HMB supplementation on endurance performance in a healthy population were included. The quality of the studies was assessed by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The study protocol was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Review (PROSPERO): CRD42022341790. Eleven studies involving 279 participants met the inclusion criteria. The results displayed a significant improvement on endurance performance (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.58 [0.28-0.87]) and V\u0307O 2 max (pooled SMD = 0.58 [0.21-0.95]) after HMB ingestion. Moreover, after the exclusion of the studies not evenly distributed around the base of the funnel plot, the results continued to be significantly positive in endurance performance (pooled SMD = 0.38 [0.22-0.53]) and V\u0307O 2 max (pooled SMD = 0.25 [0.09-0.42]). In conclusion, HMB (3 g\u00b7d -1 ) ingestion during 2-12 weeks significantly improves endurance performance and V\u0307O 2 max .",

          "content": "The aim of this study was to verify the effect of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation on physical capacity, body composition and the value of biochemical parameters in highly-trained combat sports athletes. Forty-two males highly-trained in combat sports were subjected to 12 weeks of supplementation with HMB and a placebo in a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind crossover manner. Over the course of the experiment, aerobic and anaerobic capacity was determined, while analyses were conducted on body composition and levels of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, testosterone, cortisol and lactate. Following HMB supplementation, fat-free mass increased ( = 0.049) with a simultaneous reduction of fat mass ( = 0.016) in comparison to placebo. In turn, after HMB supplementation, the following indicators increased significantly in comparison to the placebo: the time to reach ventilatory threshold ( < 0.0001), threshold load ( = 0.017) and the threshold HR ( < 0.0001), as well as anaerobic peak power ( = 0.005), average power ( = 0.029), maximum speed ( < 0.001) and post-exercise lactate concentrations ( < 0.0001). However, when compared to the placebo, no differences were observed in blood marker levels. The results indicate that supplying HMB promotes advantageous changes in body composition and stimulates an increase in aerobic and anaerobic capacity in combat sports athletes.",

          "title": "Effect of the Combination of Creatine Monohydrate Plus HMB Supplementation on Sports Performance, Body Composition, Markers of Muscle Damage and Hormone Status: A Systematic Review.",
          "content": "Although there are many studies showing the isolated effect of creatine monohydrate (CrM) and \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB), it is not clear what effect they have when they are combined. The main purpose of this systematic review was to determine the efficacy of mixing CrM plus HMB in comparison with their isolated effects on sports performance, body composition, exercise induced markers of muscle damage, and anabolic-catabolic hormones. This systematic review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement guidelines and the PICOS model, for the definition of the inclusion criteria. Studies were found by searching PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science (WOS), and Scopus electronic databases from inception to July 3rd 2019. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed by two authors independently, and disagreements were resolved by third-party evaluation, in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines samples. The literature was examined regarding the effects of the combination of CrM plus HMB on sport performance using several outcome variables (athletic performance, body composition, markers of muscle damage, and hormone status). This systematic review included six articles that investigated the effects of CrM plus HMB on sport performance (two on strength performance, showing improvements in one of them; three on anaerobic performance, presenting enhancements in two of them; and one on aerobic performance, not presenting improvements), body composition (three on body mass, showing improvements in one of them; two on fat free mass, presenting increases in one of them; and two on fat mass, showing decreases in one of them) and markers of muscle damage and hormone status (four on markers of muscle damage and one on anabolic-catabolic hormones, not showing benefits in any of them). In summary, the combination of 3-10 g/day of CrM plus 3 g/day of HMB for 1-6 weeks could produce potential positive effects on sport performance (strength and anaerobic performance) and for 4 weeks on body composition (increasing fat free mass and decreasing fat mass). However, this combination seems to not show positive effects relating to markers of exercise-induced muscle damage and anabolic-catabolic hormones.",

Cluster-randomized controlled trial. Seventy-two institutionalized older adults (age\u2009=\u200983\u2009\u00b1\u200910 years old; 63% women) were randomized in four groups: exercise plus placebo (EX), HMB supplementation, EX plus HMB supplementation (EX\u2009+\u2009HMB), and control (CT). The exercising participants completed a 12-week tailored multicomponent exercise intervention (Vivifrail; 5 days/week of an individualized resistance, cardiovascular, balance and flexibility program), whereas the HMB groups received a drink containing 3\u2009g/day of HMB. Participants were assessed Pre and Post intervention for disability and cognitive function (validated questionnaires), physical function (short physical performance battery, SPPB), handgrip strength and sit-to-stand relative muscle power. Linear mixed-effect models were used to compare changes among groups. Compared to baseline, both EX and EX\u2009+\u2009HMB improved cognitive function (+2.9 and +1.9 points; p\u2009<\u20090.001), SPPB score (+2.9 points and +2.4 points; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and relative muscle power (+0.64 and +0.48\u2009W\u00b7kg; p\u2009<\u20090.001), while CT and HMB remained unchanged (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Significant between-group differences were noted between CT, EX and EX\u2009+\u2009HMB for cognitive function (p\u2009<\u20090.01), between CT and EX\u2009+\u2009HMB for physical function (p\u2009=\u20090.043), and between CT, EX and EX\u2009+\u2009HMB for relative muscle power (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The Vivifrail exercise program was effective in improving cognitive and physical function, and muscle power in nursing home residents, while HMB supplementation did not provide additional benefits when combined with exercise. These results emphasize the importance of physical exercise interventions in very old people as an essential basis for improving their overall health and quality of life.",

Interaction of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate free acid and adenosine triphosphate on muscle mass, strength, and power in resistance trained individuals. J Strength Cond Res 30(7): 1843-1854, 2016-Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) supplementation helps maintain performance under high fatiguing contractions and with greater fatigue recovery demands also increase. Current evidence suggests that the free acid form of \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB-FA) acts by speeding regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle after high-intensity or prolonged exercise. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 12 weeks of HMB-FA (3 g) and ATP (400 mg) administration on lean body mass (LBM), strength, and power in trained individuals. A 3-phase double-blind, placebo-, and diet-controlled study was conducted. Phases consisted of an 8-week periodized resistance training program (phase 1), followed by a 2-week overreaching cycle (phase 2), and a 2-week taper (phase 3). Lean body mass was increased by a combination of HMB-FA/ATP by 12.7% (p < 0.001). In a similar fashion, strength gains after training were increased in HMB-FA/ATP-supplemented subjects by 23.5% (p < 0.001). Vertical jump and Wingate power were increased in the HMB-FA/ATP-supplemented group compared with the placebo-supplemented group, and the 12-week increases were 21.5 and 23.7%, respectively. During the overreaching cycle, strength and power declined in the placebo group (4.3-5.7%), whereas supplementation with HMB-FA/ATP resulted in continued strength gains (1.3%). In conclusion, HMB-FA and ATP in combination with resistance exercise training enhanced LBM, power, and strength. In addition, HMB-FA plus ATP blunted the typical response to overreaching, resulting in a further increase in strength during that period. It seems that the combination of HMB-FA/ATP could benefit those who continuously train at high levels such as elite athletes or military personnel.",

A cohort of 58 highly trained males was subjected to 12-week supplementation with HMB (3 \u00d7 1 gHMB\u00b7d) and a placebo (PLA) in randomized, PLA controlled, double-blind crossover trials, with a 10-day washout period. Body composition and aerobic capacity were recorded, whereas the levels of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, testosterone, cortisol, and lactate, as well as the T/C ratio, in blood samples were measured. After HMB supplementation, fat-free mass increased (+0.2 kgHMB vs. -1.0 kgPLA, p = 0.021), with a simultaneous reduction of fat mass (-0.8 kgHMB vs. +0.8 kgPLA, p < 0.001).

Analysis of the tested biochemical markers shows significant differences only in relation to the initial concentration. In HMB group, testosterone levels increased (p = 0.047) and in both groups (HMB: p = 0.008; PLA: p = 0.008) higher cortisol levels were observed.

Eight cyclists randomly (double blind) completed 3 2-week supplementation periods (HMB, 3g.day(-1); leucine [LEU], 3g.day(-1); placebo [CON], 3g.day(-1)) followed by a 2-week washout period. Testing consisted of a graded cycle ergometry test to measure .V(O)(2)peak and OBLA, the .V(O)(2) at 2 mM blood lactate. .V(O)(2)peak was unaffected by HMB (4.0 +/- 1.4%), LEU (-1.9 +/- 1.3%), and CON (-2.6 +/- 2.6%). HMB resulted in a greater time to reach .V(O)(2)peak, whereas LEU and CON did not affect this time (HMB, 3.6 +/- 1.5 min, LEU, -1.2 +/- 1.5 min; CON, -3.6 +/- 3.5 min). Lactate accumulation peak was unaffected by supplementation (HMB, 8.1 +/- 1.1 mM; LEU, 6.2 +/- 0.8 mM; CON, 7.5 +/- 1.3 mM). OBLA increased with HMB (9.1 +/- 2.4%) and LEU (2.1 +/- 1.5%), but not in the CON trial (0.75 +/- 2.1%). Blood glucose was significantly greater during the HMB trial compared with the LEU trial. It is concluded that HMB supplementation may have positive affects on performance by increasing the onset of blood lactate accumulation; however, the mechanism is unknown.",

          "content": "Creatine monohydrate (CrM) and \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) are common ergogenic aids in the field of sports and are frequently used in an isolated way. However, there are a few studies that have investigated the effect of combining both supplements on different variables related to performance, with controversial results. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and the degree of potentiation of 10 weeks of CrM plus HMB supplementation on sports performance, which was measured by an incremental test to exhaustion in elite male traditional rowers. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 10-week study, participants ( = 28) were randomized to a placebo group (PLG;  = 7), CrM group (0.04 g/kg/day of CrM;  = 7), HMB group (3 g/day of HMB;  = 7) and CrM-HMB group (0.04 g/kg/day of CrM plus 3 g/day of HMB;  = 7). Before and after 10 weeks of different treatments, an incremental test was performed on a rowing ergometer to calculate the power that each rower obtained at the anaerobic threshold (WAT), and at 4 mmol (W4) and 8 mmol (W8) of blood lactate concentration. There were no significant differences in WAT and W4 among groups or in body composition. However, it was observed that the aerobic power achieved at W8 was significantly higher in the CrM-HMB group than in the PLG, CrM and HMB groups ( < 0.001; \u03b72 = 0.766). Likewise, a synergistic effect of combined supplementation was found for the sum of the two supplements separately at WAT (CrM-HMBG = 403.19% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 337.52%), W4 (CrM-HMBG = 2736.17% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 1705.32%) and W8 (CrM-HMBG = 1293.4% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 877.56%). In summary, CrM plus HMB supplementation over 10 weeks showed a synergistic effect on aerobic power (measured as WAT, W4, and W8) during an incremental test but had no influence muscle mass.",

          "content": "The use of ergogenic nutritional supplements is becoming inseparable from competitive sports. \u03b2-Hydroxy-\u03b2-Methylbutyric acid (HMB) has recently been suggested to promote fat-free mass (FFM) and strength gains during resistance training in adults. In this prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we studied the effect of HMB (3 g/day) supplementation on body composition, muscle strength, anaerobic and aerobic capacity, anabolic/catabolic hormones and inflammatory mediators in elite, national team level adolescent volleyball players (13.5-18 years, 14 males, 14 females, Tanner stage 4-5) during the first 7 weeks of the training season. HMB led to a significant greater increase in FFM by skinfold thickness (56.4 \u00b1 10.2 to 56.3 \u00b1 8.6 vs. 59.3 \u00b1 11.3 to 61.6 \u00b1 11.3 kg in the control and HMB group, respectively, p < 0.001). HMB led to a significant greater increase in both dominant and non-dominant knee flexion isokinetic force/FFM, measured at fast (180\u00b0/sec) and slow (60\u00b0/sec) angle speeds, but had no significant effect on knee extension and elbow flexion and extension. HMB led to a significant greater increase in peak and mean anaerobic power determined by the Wingate anaerobic test (peak power: 15.5 \u00b1 1.6 to 16.2 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 15.4 \u00b1 1.6 to 17.2 \u00b1 1.2 watts/FFM, mean power: 10.6 \u00b1 0.9 to 10.8 \u00b1 1.1 vs. 10.7 \u00b1 0.8 to 11.8 \u00b1 1.0 watts/FFM in control and HMB group, respectively, p < 0.01), with no effect on fatigue index. HMB had no significant effect on aerobic fitness or on anabolic (growth hormone, IGF-I, testosterone), catabolic (cortisol) and inflammatory mediators (IL-6 and IL-1 receptor antagonist). HMB supplementation was associated with greater increases in muscle mass, muscle strength and anaerobic properties with no effect on aerobic capacity suggesting some advantage for its use in elite adolescent volleyball players during the initial phases of the training season. These effects were not accompanied by hormonal and inflammatory mediator changes.",

          "content": "Although older people are particularly liable to sarcopenia, limited research is available on beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation in this population, particularly in healthy subjects. In this parallel-group, randomized, controlled, open-label trial, we aimed to evaluate whether an oral supplement containing 1.5 g of calcium HMB for 8 weeks could improve physical performance and muscle strength parameters in a group of community-dwelling healthy older women. Eighty healthy women attending a twice-weekly mild fitness program were divided into two equal groups of 40, and 32 of the treated women and 33 control completed the study. We considered a change in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score as the primary outcome and changes in the peak torque (PT) isometric and isokinetic strength of the lower limbs, 6-minute walking test (6MWT), handgrip strength and endurance as secondary outcomes. Body composition was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT). The mean difference between the two groups on pre-post change were finally calculated (delta) for each outcome. After 8 weeks, there were no significant differences between the groups\u2019 SPPB, handgrip strength or DXA parameters. The group treated with HMB scored significantly better than the control group for PT isokinetic flexion (delta = 1.56\u00b11.56 Nm; p = 0.03) and extension (delta = 3.32\u00b12.61 Nm; p = 0.03), PT isometric strength (delta = 9.74\u00b13.90 Nm; p = 0.02), 6MWT (delta = 7.67\u00b18.29 m; p = 0.04), handgrip endurance (delta = 21.41\u00b116.28 s; p = 0.02), and muscle density assessed with pQCT. No serious adverse effects were reported in either group. In conclusion, a nutritional supplement containing 1.5 g of calcium HMB for 8 weeks in healthy elderly women had no significant effects on SPPB, but did significantly improve several muscle strength and physical performance parameters.

Subjects (n = 13) were paired according to their 2-mile run times and past running experience. Each pair was randomly assigned a treatment of either HMB (3 g/day) or a placebo. After 6 wk of daily training and supplementation, all subjects participated in a prolonged run (20-km course). Creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were measured before and after a prolonged run to assess muscle damage. The placebo-supplemented group exhibited a significantly greater (treatment main effect, P = 0.05) increase in creatine phosphokinase activity after a prolonged run than did the HMB-supplemented group. In addition, LDH activity was significantly lower (treatment main effect, P = 0.003) with HMB supplementation compared with the placebo-supplemented group. In conclusion, supplementation with 3.0 g of HMB results in a decreased creatine phosphokinase and LDH response after a prolonged run.

Furthermore, to investigate if a conventional exercise training program, a subcategory of physical activity, could lower plasma BCAA along with alterations in IHL content in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and people with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). To investigate the effect of physical activity on the association between plasma BCAA and IHL content, linear regression analyses were performed in 1983 individuals from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) stratified by physical activity frequency. Furthermore, the effect of a 12-week supervised combined aerobic resistance-exercise program on plasma BCAA, insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), and IHL (proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS)) was investigated in seven patients with T2DM, seven individuals with NAFL and seven BMI-matched control participants (CON). We observed positive associations between plasma valine, isoleucine and leucine level, and IHL content (1.29 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.38), 1.52 (95% CI: 1.43, 1.61), and 1.54 (95% CI: 1.44, 1.64) times IHL, respectively, per standard deviation of plasma amino acid level). Similar associations were observed in less active versus more active individuals. Exercise training did not change plasma BCAA levels among groups, but reduced IHL content in NAFL (from 11.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0% pre-exercise to 8.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0% post exercise, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and CON (from 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6% pre-exercise to 1.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4% post exercise, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and improved peripheral insulin sensitivity in NAFL as well by ~23% (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The association between plasma BCAA levels and IHL is not affected by physical activity level. Exercise training reduced IHL without affecting plasma BCAA levels in individuals with NAFL and CON. We conclude that exercise training-induced reduction in IHL content is not related to changes in plasma BCAA levels. Trial registry number: NCT01317576.",

          "content": "This study aimed to determine the effect of postexercise protein-leucine coingestion with CHO-lipid on subsequent high-intensity endurance performance and to investigate candidate mechanisms using stable isotope methods and metabolomics. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 male cyclists ingested a leucine/protein/CHO/fat supplement (LEUPRO 7.5/20/89/22 g \u00b7 h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric CHO/fat control (119/22 g \u00b7 h(-1)) 1-3 h after exercise during a 6-d training block (intense intervals, recovery, repeated-sprint performance rides). Daily protein intake was clamped at 1.9 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (LEUPRO) and 1.5 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (control). Stable isotope infusions (1-(13)C-leucine and 6,6-(2)H2-glucose), mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and nitrogen balance methods were used to determine the effects of LEUPRO on whole-body branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and glucose metabolism and protein turnover. After exercise, LEUPRO increased BCAA levels in plasma (2.6-fold; 90% confidence limits = \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and urine (2.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.2) and increased products of BCAA metabolism plasma acylcarnitine C5 (3.0-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 0.9) and urinary leucine (3.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.3) and \u03b2-aminoisobutyrate (3.4-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.4), indicating that ingesting ~10 g leucine per hour during recovery exceeds the capacity to metabolize BCAA. Furthermore, LEUPRO increased leucine oxidation (5.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and nonoxidative disposal (4.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and left leucine balance positive relative to control. With the exception of day 1 (LEUPRO = 17 \u00b1 20 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = -90 \u00b1 44 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)), subsequent (days 2-5) nitrogen balance was positive for both conditions (LEUPRO = 130 \u00b1 110 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = 111 \u00b1 86 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)). Compared with control feeding, LEUPRO lowered the serum creatine kinase concentration by 21%-25% (90% confidence limits = \u00b1 14%), but the effect on sprint power was trivial (day 4 = 0.4% \u00b1 1.0%, day 6 = -0.3% \u00b1 1.0%). Postexercise protein-leucine supplementation saturates BCAA metabolism and attenuates tissue damage, but effects on subsequent intense endurance performance may be inconsequential under conditions of positive daily nitrogen balance.",

          "content": "The decline in cognitive performance has been shown after fatiguing exercise. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been suggested to alleviate exercise-induced central fatigue. Arginine and citrulline could remove the excess NH3 accumulation accompanied with BCAA supplementation by increasing nitric oxide biosynthesis and/or urea cycle. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the combined supplementation of BCAA, arginine, and citrulline on central fatigue after three simulated matches in well-trained taekwondo athletes. In a double-blind randomized cross-over design, 12 male taekwondo athletes performed two trials containing three simulated matches each. Each match contained three 2-min rounds of high-intensity intermittent exercise. At the end of the second match, two different supplementations were consumed. In the AA trial, the subjects ingested 0.17\u00a0g/kg BCAA, 0.05\u00a0g/kg arginine and 0.05\u00a0g/kg citrulline, while placebo was consumed in the PL trial. A validated taekwondo-specific reaction test battery was used to measure the cognitive performance after each match. The premotor reaction time in the three single-task tests and the reaction time in the secondary task in the dual-task test were maintained in the AA trial after three matches, while they were impaired in the PL trial, resulting in significantly better performance in the AA trial. These improvements in the AA trial coincided with significantly lower plasma free tryptophan/BCAA ratio, increased NOx concentrations, and similar NH3 concentrations. This study suggested that the combined supplementation could alleviate the exercise-induced central fatigue in elite athletes.",

          "content": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), comprising leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val), are essential nutrients vital for protein synthesis and metabolic regulation via specialized signaling networks. Their association with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has become a focal point of scientific debate, with emerging evidence suggesting both beneficial and detrimental roles. This review aims to dissect the multifaceted relationship between BCAAs and cardiovascular health, exploring the molecular mechanisms and clinical implications. Elevated BCAA levels have also been linked to insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), inflammation, and dyslipidemia, which are well-established risk factors for CVD. Central to these processes are key pathways such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activate B cells (NF-\u03baB)-mediated inflammation, and oxidative stress. Additionally, the interplay between BCAA metabolism and gut microbiota, particularly the production of metabolites like trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), adds another layer of complexity. Contrarily, some studies propose that BCAAs may have cardioprotective effects under certain conditions, contributing to muscle maintenance and metabolic health. This review critically evaluates the evidence, addressing the biological basis and signal transduction mechanism, and also discusses the potential for BCAAs to act as biomarkers versus active mediators of cardiovascular pathology. By presenting a balanced analysis, this review seeks to clarify the contentious roles of BCAAs in CVD, providing a foundation for future research and therapeutic strategies required because of the rising prevalence, incidence, and total burden of CVDs.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia is associated with adverse outcomes in cirrhosis. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) target several pathways that lead to muscle loss in this population. We aimed to evaluate the impact of BCAA supplementation on sarcopenia measures in patients with cirrhosis. We conducted a 12-month double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial of BCAA supplementation (30\u2009g daily) compared to an equicaloric, equi-nitrogenous whey protein in volunteers with cirrhosis and reduced muscle strength. The primary endpoint was an increase in grip strength and upper limb lean mass measured on DEXA. Mean-adjusted differences (MAD, 95% CI) between groups at 6 and 12 months are reported as treatment effect using a linear mixed model for repeated measures. A total of 150 volunteers entered the trial (74 BCAA, 76 control), with a median age of 58\u2009years [IQR 48; 63] and MELD of 14 [12; 17]. At 12 months, 57% in the BCAA arm and 61% in the control arm met the primary endpoint (p\u2009=\u20090.80). No significant between-group difference was found in grip strength (MAD -0.15\u2009kg [-0.37; 0.06], p\u2009=\u20090.29) or upper limb lean mass (1.7\u2009kg [-0.2; 3.6], p\u2009=\u20090.22) at 12 months. No significant differences in other body composition parameters, physical performance, frailty, rates of hospitalisation or mortality were found between the BCAA and the control group. Fatigue improved across the entire cohort, without significant between-group differences. 15% of volunteers reported side effects, with distaste higher in the BCAA arm (p\u2009=\u20090.045).

          "title": "The Influence of Competition Day Loads on the Metabolic and Immune Response of Olympic Female Beach Volleyball Athletes: A Sportomics Analysis.",
          "content": "Beach volleyball (BVb) is a highly demanding Olympic sport characterized by intense physical activity and unique environmental challenges, including varying weather conditions and sandy, unstable court surfaces. Despite its popularity, there is a notable lack of scientific research addressing the metabolic and immune responses of elite female athletes in this sport. This study aims to address this gap by investigating two world-class Olympic medalists, female BVb players, who represent a country with a rich history in the sport.  Two athletes underwent a simulated competition day consisting of two matches. A standardized protocol was utilized to collect blood and urine samples at seven time points, allowing for analysis throughout the competition and recovery phases. The analysis included various electrolytes, as well as hematological, metabolic, and inflammatory markers. Additionally, we assessed selected hormones, such as insulin, serotonin, ACTH, and cortisol, along with amino acids related to energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis.  Both athletes presented a trend toward electrolyte disturbances, especially hypokalemia, with a mean decrease of 15% and individual values reaching as low as 3.3 mmol/L post-match. This indicates that BVb may pose a risk for such disturbances. Additionally, the matches led to 20% to 60% increases in muscle injury markers, with incomplete recovery even after a day of rest, signaling persistent physiological stress post-competition. This increase was matched by stimulating stress hormones (ACTH and cortisol rose up to 4-fold and 3-fold, respectively), and markers of exercise intensity, such as lactate and ammonium. Moreover, the simulated BVb competition day impacted the amino acid response, with the Fischer ratio (BCAA/AAA) and blood tryptophan decreasing to a minimum of 60% of the initial levels and blood serotonin increasing by up to 180%, which are signs of an increased risk of central fatigue onset, according to the Fischer and Newsholme theory.  The responses examined in this exploratory study contribute to a deeper understanding of the metabolic and immune demands placed on elite female BVb players, suggesting practical applications. By addressing the similar physiological responses observed among the athletes and emphasizing their unique individual responses-despite following the same protocol under identical conditions and sharing similar life habits for an extended period-this study highlights the critical necessity for the n-of-1 monitoring of athletes.",

          "content": "Despite the role of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in physiological processes such as nutrient signaling and protein synthesis, there is ongoing debate about the link between circulating BCAAs and insulin resistance (IR) in various populations. In healthy women, IR mildly increases during pregnancy, whereas both BCAAs and markers of BCAA catabolism decrease, indicating that fetal growth is being prioritized. Exercise reduces IR in nonpregnant adults, but less is known about the effect of exercise during pregnancy in women with obesity on IR and BCAA breakdown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a moderate-intensity exercise intervention during pregnancy on maternal circulating BCAAs and markers of BCAA catabolism [short-chain acylcarnitines (ACs)], and their associations with IR. Healthy obese [ = 80, means \u00b1 SD; body mass index (BMI): 36.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7\u2009kg/m] pregnant women were randomized into an exercise ( = 40, aerobic/resistance 3\u00d7/wk, \u223c13th gestation week until birth) or a nonexercise control ( = 40) group. Blood was collected at 12.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 and 36.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 gestation weeks and analyzed for BCAA-derived acylcarnitine concentrations as markers of BCAA breakdown toward oxidative pathways, and glucose and insulin concentrations [updated homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA2-IR)]. After adjusting for HOMA2-IR, there were no interaction effects of group by time. In addition, there was a main positive effect of time on HOMA2-IR (12\u2009wk: 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2, 36\u2009wk: 3.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2,  = 0.003). A moderate-intensity exercise intervention during pregnancy in women with obesity was not associated with changes in BCAA-derived ACs versus standard of care. The decrease in BCAA-derived ACs throughout gestation could not be explained by IR. This research showed an increase in insulin resistance (IR) and decrease in branched-chain amino acid catabolism throughout gestation in women with obesity, and addition of a moderate exercise intervention (known to attenuate IR in nonpregnant populations) did not alter these shifts. Findings provide support for metabolic safety of exercise during pregnancy.",

The purpose of this investigation was to study the effects of a 60-min bout of vigorous treadmill running with dietary manipulation on plasma concentrations of glutamine, FTrp and BCAA after an exercise and diet regime designed to reduce muscle glycogen. Seven male distance runners [mean (SD) age: 29.3 (2.1) years; VO2max: 62.7 (3.3) ml.kg-1.min-1] acted as subjects. Each undertook a regime designed to reduce muscle glycogen, then performed a 60-min treadmill run (75% VO2max) under two dietary conditions: after a 14-h fast (fasted) and after ingestion of a high carbohydrate meal (30 kJ.kg-1: 80% carbohydrate, 10% protein, 10% fat) 3 h before running (fed). Plasma concentrations of glutamine, FTrp, BCAA, free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol and glucose were measured 5 min before and 5 min after the run, under each dietary condition. Plasma glutamine did not change in response to exercise when fasted (P > 0.05), but increased when fed (P = 0.007). Plasma FTrp increased under both dietary conditions (P < 0.001), but the magnitude of this increase was greater when fasted than when fed (P < 0.001). Plasma BCAA did not change under either dietary condition (P < 0.05). Increases in the plasma FTrp/BCAA ratio reflected increases in plasma FFA and glycerol concentrations (P < 0.001; both dietary conditions) and these changes were all greater under fasted conditions when a fall in blood glucose concentration was observed (P = 0.007).

          "title": "Prolonged increase in glutamate whole body and intracellular production in older adults with COPD and healthy controls post-resistance exercise.",
          "content": "Exercise training is essential for pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet patient responsiveness varies widely. We previously observed metabolic disturbances in amino acids critical for muscle health-such as glutamate, glutamine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and taurine-in COPD patients after an endurance exercise session, possibly related to increased energy demands and oxidative stress. However, the impact of resistance exercise on these metabolic pathways remains unclear. We measured plasma concentration, whole-body production (WBP), and intracellular production of glutamate, glutamine, BCAAs, and taurine using stable isotope pulse techniques in 24 COPD and 25 healthy older participants. Measurements were obtained before, and at 1 and 24\u00a0h after, a resistance exercise session. At baseline, COPD participants exhibited lower WBP of glutamine, taurine, and BCAAs compared to healthy participants (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Resistance exercise increased WBP of glutamate by 37-42\u00a0%, glutamine by 9-10\u00a0%, and intracellular glutamate production by 37-40\u00a0%, while decreasing WBP of taurine by 7\u00a0% (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). These effects persisted at 24\u00a0h post-exercise (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Although WBP of BCAAs remained unchanged, plasma leucine and isoleucine levels decreased by 16\u00a0% and 13\u00a0%, respectively, in COPD participants post-exercise (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). A single resistance exercise session alters glutamate-related metabolism for at least 24\u00a0h in healthy and COPD participants. A high BCAA clearance is likely required to rapidly upregulate glutamate production in COPD to meet increased energy demands, but this occurs at the cost of lowering plasma levels of BCAA necessary for muscle anabolism.

          "content": "In the last years a shift in amino acid profile was discussed as one reason for the development of staleness. Signs of staleness are among others susceptibility to infection and disturbances in well-being. Beside tryptophane and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) glutamine is the most discussed amino acid (AA) in this context. Based on the hypothesis of a multifactorial genesis of staleness and these AA being the metabolic link in psychoimmunology, seven young swimmers of regional top level were examined in a longitudinal field monitoring for biochemical, biomechanical and psycho-physiological data at six different training phases across one year. Special interest was spent on phases with the highest training loads (HT I and II) because of the increased risk of appearance of staleness compared with the regeneration phase (RP). The results point out that well controlled and regulated HT does not reduce but increases the plasma levels of glutamate (means and SD; RP 20 +/- 8 micromol/l, HT I 34 +/- 11 micromol/l), glutamine (RP 489 +/- 155 micromol/l, HT I 634 +/- 113 micromol/l) and BCAA (valine RP 164 +/- 54 micro mol/l, HT I 283 +/- 58 micromol/l, isoleucine RP 59 +/- 20 micromol/l, HT I 101 +/- 24 micromol/l, leucine RP 88 +/- 32 micromol/l, HT I 142 +/- 35 micro mol/l). The immunological parameters did not show any significant training-induced changes (sIL-2-R: RP 422 +/- 98 U/ml, HT I 522 +/- 70 U/ml, s-ICAM: RP 157 +/- 11 ng/ml, HT I 185 +/- 32 ng/ml) and don't seem to be suitable as indicators for a \"biochemical-psychophysiological\" justified control and regulation of training. Possibly the increasing of plasma concentrations of AA by intensive and high volume endurance training is the \"store shape\" of AA in view of saving and provisioning the organism for further exhausting training loads.",

          "content": "To reveal the role of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in the development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the effect on the incidence of subsequent cardiovascular disease. A total of 1302 subjects in the cohort study of the Huai'an Diabetes Prevention Program were divided into two groups according to whether NAFLD was present at baseline. The group without NAFLD at baseline was only followed up, and the group with NAFLD at baseline received diet and exercise interventions. Anthropometric and biochemical examinations were performed at baseline and at the end of 4\u00a0years for all subjects. Serum BCAA (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) levels were measured by hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The associations of baseline serum BCAA levels with the risk for NAFLD, coronary heart disease (CHD), and cardiovascular events (CVEs) after 4\u00a0years were further evaluated. (1) At baseline and after the 4-year follow-up, baseline serum leucine, valine, and total BCAAs in the NAFLD group were significantly higher than those in the non-NAFLD group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). (2) According to whether NAFLD was present at baseline and after follow-up, all subjects were divided into four groups, including the control group, new case group, improvement group, and unchanged group. There was no significant difference in baseline BCAAs levels between the new case group and the improvement group (p\u2009>\u20090.05). (3) Risk factors for the occurrence and development of NAFLD were analysed by a multiple logistic regression model according to whether NAFLD existed at baseline. Serum leucine (OR\u2009=\u20091.058, 95% CI 1.005-1.114, p\u2009=\u20090.033) and total BCAAs (OR\u2009=\u20091.023, 95% CI 1.001-1.046, p\u2009=\u20090.045) were independent risk factors for new-onset NAFLD. Serum valine (OR\u2009=\u20091.131, 95% CI 1.043-1.226, p\u2009=\u20090.003), and total BCAAs (OR\u2009=\u20091.040, 95% CI 1.003-1.078, p\u2009=\u20090.035) were independent risk factors showing that NAFLD could not be reversed. (4) The cross-table Chi-square test showed that the incidence of both CHD and CVEs was significantly highest in the new case group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). (5) After adjusting for confounding factors, baseline isoleucine, valine, and BCAA levels were independently associated with new-onset CHD in subjects with or without NAFLD at baseline (p\u2009<\u20090.05). High BCAA levels exacerbate the risk of CHD and CVEs by influencing the occurrence and progression of NAFLD. However, lifestyle interventions could reverse the risk of NAFLD, CHD and CVEs associated with BCAAs.",

However, there is no study comparing this coingestion to the same nutrients without caffeine. We assessed whether ketone salts-caffeine-taurine-leucine (KCT) supplementation was superior to caffeine-free ketone salts-taurine-leucine supplementation (KT), or to an isoenergetic carbohydrate placebo (CHO-PLAC). Thirteen recreationally active men (mean \u00b1 SD: 177.5 \u00b1 6.1\u00a0cm, 75.9 \u00b1 4.6\u00a0kg, 23 \u00b1 3 years, 12.0 \u00b1 5.1% body fat) completed a best effort 20-km cycling time-trial, followed 15\u00a0min later by a Wingate power cycle test, after supplementing with either KCT (approximately 7\u00a0g of beta-hydroxybutyrate, approximately 120\u00a0mg of caffeine, 2.1\u00a0g of leucine, and 2.7\u00a0g of taurine), KT (i.e.,\u00a0same supplement without caffeine), or isoenergetic CHO-PLAC (11\u00a0g of dextrose). Blood ketones were elevated (p < .001) after ingestion of both KCT (0.65 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0mmol/L) and KT (0.72 \u00b1 0.31\u00a0mmol/L) relative to CHO-PLAC (0.06 \u00b1 0.05\u00a0mmol/L). Moreover, KCT improved (p < .003) 20-km cycling time-trial performance (37.80 \u00b1 2.28\u00a0min), compared with CHO-PLAC (39.40 \u00b1 3.33\u00a0min) but not versus KT (38.75 \u00b1 2.87\u00a0min; p < .09). 20-km cycling time-trial average power output was greater with KCT (power output = 180.5 \u00b1 28.7\u00a0W) versus both KT (170.9 \u00b1 31.7\u00a0W; p = .049) and CHO-PLAC (164.8 \u00b1 34.7\u00a0W; p = .001). Wingate peak power output was also greater for both KCT (1,134 \u00b1 137\u00a0W; p = .031) and KT (1,132 \u00b1 128\u00a0W; p = .039) versus CHO-PLAC (1,068 \u00b1 127\u00a0W). These data suggest that the observed improved exercise performance effects of this multi-ingredient supplement containing beta-hydroxybutyrate salts, taurine, and leucine are attributed partially to the addition of caffeine.",

Determining its exact functional roles represents a complex and multifaceted topic. We provide an overview of the scientific literature and present an analysis of the effects of taurine on various aspects of human health, focusing on aging and cardiovascular pathophysiology, but also including athletic performance, metabolic regulation, and neurological function. Additionally, our report summarizes the current recommendations for taurine intake and addresses potential safety concerns. Evidence from both human and animal studies indicates that taurine may have beneficial cardiovascular effects, including blood pressure regulation, improved cardiac fitness, and enhanced vascular health. Its mechanisms of action and antioxidant properties make it also an intriguing candidate for potential anti-aging strategies.",

A total of 16 sub-elite female rugby athletes (21.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u2009yr, 168.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u2009cm, 62.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5\u2009kg mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) participated in this research. Following familiarization, participants attended 4 successive tests separated by 72 h in a randomized, counter-balanced, crossover research design. Following an over night fast, participants completed a 5-min 60\u2009Watt warm-up followed by a 30-s Wingate anaerobic test on a cycle ergometer after ingestion of either 2\u2009g taurine (LOWTAU), 4\u2009g (MODTAU), 6\u2009g (HIGHTAU) or placebo (PLA) 1 h before the test. Peak (PP) and mean power (MP) along with heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), capillary lactate and blood glucose were measured. LOWTAU did not affect PP, MP, HR, lactate and glucose compared to PLA (\u2009>\u20090.05), while MODTAU improved MP and HIGHTAU improved PP and MP compared to PLA and LOWTAU (\u2009<\u20090.05). MODTAU and HIGHTAU had little effect on HR, blood lactate and glucose (\u2009>\u20090.05). A single dose of taurine (MODTAU or HIGHTAU) 1\u2009h prior to competition or training would provide an ergogenic effect on subsequent power output.",

J Strength Cond Res 34(12): 3475-3481, 2020-This study investigated the effects of caffeine and taurine coingestion on repeat-sprint cycling performance and associated physiological and perceptual responses. In a double-blind, cross-over, repeated measures study, 11 male subjects (age 21 \u00b1 2 years; stature 178 \u00b1 7 cm; body mass 80 \u00b1 13 kg) completed 10 \u00d7 6-second sprints on a cycle ergometer, each separated by 24 seconds, one hour after ingesting: caffeine (80 mg) and taurine (1 g), equivalent to the amount observed in popular commercial energy drinks, or placebo (maltodextrin \u223c1 g) in a gelatine capsule. Performance was measured on a cycle ergometer, whereas blood lactate concentration (B[la]), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and heart rate (HR) were measured at baseline (pre-exercise) and after sprints 5 and 10. Magnitude-based inferences revealed likely, trivial differences in peak power and unclear, trivial intersprint fatigue index after ingestion of the caffeine and taurine supplement. Intrasprint fatigue was greater in the caffeine and taurine condition at sprint 10 (likely, small) and possibly smaller in sprints 6-9. The caffeine and taurine supplement had a likely large effect on HR at baseline (effect size = 0.94) and increases in B[la] after sprints 5 (likely small) and 10 (possibly small). There was no effect of the supplement on RPE (unclear, trivial). Administration of caffeine and taurine at doses equivalent to commercial energy drinks did not improve repeat-sprint cycling performance and seemed to induce greater fatigue within selected sprints, particularly at the end of the trial. This undesirable performance effect occurs in parallel with increased HR and glycolytic metabolic bi-products.",

A double-blind, acute, and crossover study design was conducted. Seventeen men (age 24.8 \u00b1 4.07y; BMI: 23.9 \u00b1 2.57 kg/m\u00b2) participated in the present study. Different doses of taurine (TAU) (3 g or 6 g) or placebo were supplemented 90 minutes before a single bout of fasting aerobic exercise (on a treadmill at 60% of VO2 max). The subjects performed three trials, and each one was separated by seven days. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after the exercise protocol of each test to analyze plasma levels of glycerol and taurine. Lipid and carbohydrate oxidation were determined immediately after exercise for 15 minutes by indirect calorimetry. We observed that TAU supplementation (6 g) increased lipid oxidation (38%) and reduced the respiratory coefficient (4%) when compared to the placebo ( < 0.05). However, no differences in lipid oxidation were observed between the different doses of taurine (3 g and 6 g). For glycerol concentrations, there were no differences between trials. Six grams of TAU supplementation 90 minutes before a single bout of aerobic exercise in a fasted state was sufficient to increase the lipid oxidation post-exercise in healthy young men.",

To evaluate the effects of isolated oral taurine ingestion on endurance performance and to assess the contribution of (1) the dose and (2) the supplementation period to the ergogenic effect. A search was performed using various databases in September 2017. The studies were screened using search criteria for eligibility. Ten peer-reviewed articles were identified for inclusion. A sub-analysis of time-to-exhaustion (TTE) trials (n = 7) was also performed. The effects of (1) dose and (2) the acute (single dose) or chronic (> 1 day) supplementation periods were assessed using meta-regression. The doses of taurine ranged from 1 to 6\u00a0g/day and were provided in single doses and for up to 2\u00a0weeks among a range of subjects. Taurine ingestion improved overall endurance performance (Hedges' g\u00a0=\u00a00.40, 95% CI 0.12-0.67, P = 0.004), which was similar in TTE trials (Hedges' g = 0.43, 95% CI 0.12-0.75, P = 0.007). There were no differences between acute or chronic supplementation for the full sample (P = 0.897) or the TTE group (P = 0.896). The dose of taurine did not moderate its effect on endurance performance (P > 0.05).

While the effectiveness of taurine as an ergogenic aid remains controversial, this paper summarizes the current evidence regarding the efficacy of taurine in aerobic and anaerobic performance, metabolic stress, muscle soreness, and recovery. Google Scholar, Web of Science, and MedLine (PubMed) searches were conducted through September 2020. Peer-reviewed studies that investigated taurine as a single ingredient at dosages of <\u20091\u2009g - 6\u2009g, ranging from 10 to 15\u2009min-to-2\u2009h prior to exercise bout or chronic dose (7\u2009days- 8\u2009weeks) of consumption were included. Articles were excluded if taurine was not the primary or only ingredient in a supplement or food source, not published in peer-reviewed journals, if participants were older than 50\u2009years, articles published before 1999, animal studies, or included participants with health issues. A total of 19 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Key results include improvements in the following: VOmax, time to exhaustion (TTE; n\u2009=\u20095 articles), 3 or 4\u2009km time-trial (n\u2009=\u20092 articles), anaerobic performance (n\u2009=\u20097 articles), muscle damage (n\u2009=\u20093 articles), peak power (n\u2009=\u20092 articles), recovery (n\u2009=\u20091 article). Taurine also caused a change in metabolites: decrease in lactate, creatine kinase, phosphorus, inflammatory markers, and improved glycolytic/fat oxidation markers (n\u2009=\u20095 articles). Taurine dosing appears to be effective at ~\u20091-3\u2009g/day acutely across a span of 6-15\u2009days (1-3\u2009h before an activity) which may improve aerobic performance (TTE), anaerobic performance (strength, power), recovery (DOMS), and a decrease in metabolic markers (creatine kinase, lactate, inorganic phosphate). Limited and varied findings prohibit definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of taurine on aerobic and anaerobic performance and metabolic outcomes. There are mixed findings for the effect of taurine consumption on improving recovery from training bouts and/or mitigating muscle damage. The timing of taurine ingestion as well as the type of exercise protocol performed may contribute to the effectiveness of taurine as an ergogenic aid. More investigations are needed to better understand the potential effects of taurine supplementation on aerobic and anaerobic performance, muscle damage, metabolic stress, and recovery.",

          "content": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the foremost cause of mortality globally. Taurine, an amino acid, holds promise for cardiovascular health through mechanisms such as calcium regulation, blood pressure reduction, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Despite these potential benefits, previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aims to evaluate the existing evidence on the quantitative effects of taurine on hemodynamic parameters and cardiac function grading, which are indicative of overall cardiovascular health and performance. We conducted an electronic search across multiple databases, including Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov, from their inception to January 2, 2024. Our analysis focused on key cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and New York Heart Association (NYHA)\u00a0Functional Classification. Meta-regression was applied to explore dose-dependent relationships based on the total taurine dose administered during the treatment period. A subgroup analysis, stratified according to the baseline disease status of patients, was also conducted. The analysis included a pooled sample of 808 participants from 20 randomized controlled trials. Taurine demonstrated a significant reduction in HR (weighted mean difference [WMD]\u2009=\u2009-3.579\u00a0bpm, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u2009-6.044 to -1.114, p\u2009=\u20090.004), SBP (WMD\u2009=\u2009-3.999\u00a0mm Hg, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-7.293 to -0.706, p\u2009=\u20090.017), DBP (WMD: -1.435\u00a0mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.484 to -0.386, p\u2009=\u20090.007), NYHA (WMD: -0.403, 95% CI: -0.522 to -0.283, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and a significant increase in LVEF (WMD: 4.981%, 95% CI: 1.556 to 8.407, p\u2009=\u20090.004). Meta-regression indicated a dose-dependent reduction in HR (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.0150 per g, p\u2009=\u20090.333), SBP (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.0239 per g, p\u2009=\u20090.113), DBP (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.0089 per g, p\u2009=\u20090.110), and NYHA (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.0016 per g, p\u2009=\u20090.111), and a positive correlation with LVEF (coefficient\u2009=\u20090.0285 per g, p\u2009=\u20090.308). No significant adverse effects were observed compared to controls. In subgroup analysis, taurine significantly improved HR in heart failure patients and healthy individuals. Taurine significantly reduced SBP in healthy individuals, heart failure patients, and those with other diseases, while significantly lowered DBP in hypertensive patients It notably increased LVEF in heart failure patients and improved NYHA functional class in both heart failure patients and those with other diseases. Taurine showed noteworthy effects in preventing hypertension and enhancing cardiac function. Individuals prone to CVDs may find it advantageous to include taurine in their daily regimen.",

          "content": "Taurine is released by contracting muscles, but its actual role remains unspecified. In this study, we investigated whether the exercise-stimulated release of taurine from muscle into the plasma regulates the modification of osmolality induced by intramuscular osmolyte production. Six subjects performed 90 min of cycling exercise (at 70% maximum power output) on two occasions, with (HC) or without (DC) fluid intake. Taurine content was determined in plasma, blood cells and urine before and after the endurance events, together with plasma osmolality. Plasma osmolality increased by 4% in the DC experiment ( P<0.01), but remained stable in the HC condition. The exercise also induced changes in the mean (SD) plasma taurine content to a greater degree in HC [+63 (26)%] than in DC [+33 (18)%; P<0.05], supporting the hypothesis that taurine is released into the plasma via an osmoregulatory process. However, the higher plasma taurine content in HC was not related to changes in renal taurine. In addition, the increase of taurine in plasma was not related to its release from blood cells since their taurine concentration increased by 70% both in HC [429 (77) to 680 (82) microM; P=0.003] and in DC [451 (57) to 731 (34) microM; P<0.001]. The lack of correlation between plasma volume modification and the mass ratio of taurine would exclude a major role for taurine exchange in plasma volume regulation. Sodium ( R=0.967, P<0.001), chloride ( R=0.917, P<0.001) and osmolality ( R=0.924, P<0.001) seem to be the main regulators of plasma volume changes during exercise. In conclusion, changes in the plasma taurine content during endurance exercise is related to an osmoregulatory process, but this alone does not control plasma volume changes.",

          "content": "Dynamic orchestration of metabolic pathways during continuous fasting remains unclear. We investigated the physiological effects of Bigu-style fasting and underlying metabolic reprogramming in healthy adults. We conducted a 5-d Bigu trial in 43 healthy subjects [age 23.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4 y; BMI (in kg/m2) 22.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.79]. Physiological indicators and body composition were monitored daily during fasting day 1 (F1D) to F5D and after 10-d refeeding postfasting (R10D) and R30D. Blood samples were collected in the morning. Risk factors associated with inflammation, aging, cardiovascular diseases, malnutrition, and organ dysfunction were evaluated by biochemical measurements. Untargeted plasma metabolomics and gut microbial profiling were performed using plasma and fecal samples. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction. Correlation analyses for metabolite modules and taurine were analyzed by Spearman's rank and Pearson tests, respectively. Heart rate was accelerated throughout the fasting period. Risk factors associated with inflammation and cardiovascular diseases were significantly lowered during or after Bigu (P <\u00a00.05). Body composition measurement detected an overconsumption of fat starting from F3D till 1 mo after refeeding. Metabolomics unveiled a coupling between gluconeogenesis and cholesterol biosynthesis beyond F3D. Plasma taurine significantly increased at F3D by 31%-46% followed by a reduction to basal level at F5D (P <\u00a00.001), a pattern inversely correlated with changes in glucose and de novo synthesized cholesterol (r = -0.407 and -0.296, respectively; P <\u00a00.001). Gut microbial profiling showed an enrichment of taurine-utilizing bacteria at F5D, which was completely recovered at R10D. Our data demonstrate that 5-d Bigu is potentially beneficial to health in young adults. A starvation threshold of 3-d fasting is necessary for maintaining glucose and cholesterol homeostasis via a taurine-microbiota regulatory loop. Our findings provide novel insights into the physiological and metabolic responses of the human body to continuous Bigu-style fasting.

          "content": "This study examined 1) the plasma taurine response to acute oral taurine supplementation (T), and 2) the effects of 7 days of T on muscle amino acid content and substrate metabolism during 2 h of cycling at approximately 60% peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). In the first part of the study, after an overnight fast, 7 volunteers (28+/-3 yr, 184+/-2 cm, 88.0+/-6.6 kg) ingested 1.66 g oral taurine doses with breakfast (8 AM) and lunch (12 noon), and blood samples were taken throughout the day. In the second part of the study, eight men (22+/-1 yr, 181+/-1 cm, 80.9+/-3.8 kg, 4.21+/-0.16 l/min VO2peak) cycled for 2 h after 7 days of placebo (P) ingestion (6 g glucose/day) and again following 7 days of T (5 g/day). In the first part of the study, plasma taurine was 64+/-4 microM before T and rose rapidly to 778+/-139 microM by 10 AM and remained elevated at noon (359+/-56 microM). Plasma taurine reached 973+/-181 microM at 1 PM and was 161+/-31 microM at 4 PM. In the second part of the study, seven days of T had no effect on muscle taurine content (mmol/kg dry muscle) at rest (P, 44+/-15 vs. T, 42+/-15) or after exercise (P, 43+/-12 vs. T, 43+/-11). There was no difference in muscle glycogen or other muscle metabolites between conditions, but there were notable interaction effects for muscle valine, isoleucine, leucine, cystine, glutamate, alanine, and arginine amino acid content following exercise after T. These data indicate that 1) acute T produces a 13-fold increase in plasma taurine concentration; 2) despite the ability to significantly elevate plasma taurine for extended periods throughout the day, 7 days of T does not alter skeletal muscle taurine content or carbohydrate and fat oxidation during exercise; and 3) T appears to have some impact on muscle amino acid response to exercise.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the acute effects of a single dose of taurine supplementation on exercise performance and examined potential moderators related to participant characteristics, exercise modality, dosing, and administration protocols. Six electronic databases were searched up to July 2025, identifying 23 eligible randomized trials (k\u2009=\u200969, N\u2009=\u2009308). A three-level random-effects meta-analysis indicated that acute taurine ingestion may be associated with small-to-moderate improvements in overall performance (g\u2009=\u20090.25, 95% CI [0.10, 0.39], I\u2009=\u200961%). Moderator analyses suggested that benefits were more apparent in males and across aerobic endurance, strength/power, and agility/coordination tasks, whereas evidence for anaerobic capacity and muscular endurance remained inconsistent. No significant dose-response relationship was detected within the commonly used 1-6\u2009g range, suggesting potential threshold effects rather than linear trends. Both capsule and beverage formulations appeared effective, and nonlinear meta-regression indicated that ingestion about 1\u2009h before exercise might yield the most favorable outcomes, although this timing effect was not robust in sensitivity analyses. Further analyses showed that several subgroup effects were attenuated after excluding influential studies, and prediction intervals frequently included the null, reflecting uncertainty in replicability. The overall certainty of evidence, assessed using GRADE, was rated low to very low due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias. Collectively, these findings suggest that acute single-dose taurine supplementation holds promise as an ergogenic aid, but its effectiveness likely varies depending on dosage, blinding procedures, and exercise context. Additional high-quality trials are needed to establish more definitive recommendations.",

Since taurine body content decreases with aging, we investigated the effects of supplementation (alone and combined with exercise) on oxidative stress, extracellular matrix degradation, white blood cells, neurotrophins, cognition and physical fitness of elderly women. Forty-eight women (83.58\u2009\u00b1\u20096.98\u00a0years) were enrolled into exercise training only (EO: n\u2009=\u200913), taurine supplementation (TS: n\u2009=\u200912), exercise training\u2009+\u2009taurine supplementation (ETTS: n\u2009=\u200911), and control group (CG: n\u2009=\u200912). All interventions lasted 14\u00a0weeks. Exercise was applied twice a week, and taurine was given once a day (1.5\u00a0g). Data collection occurred before and after interventions with the determination of myeloperoxidase (MPO), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF) levels, and white blood cell counts (WBC). Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and physical fitness tests were also evaluated. Concentration of MPO and MMP-9 decreased after intervention in TS (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No effect of time or time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0group was observed for WBC parameters; however, univariate analysis showed a significant decrease in lymphocytes for TS, while an increase in monocytes occurred in the CG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). MoCA scores decreased over time in the CG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Improvements in physical fitness occurred in ETTS (better agility and aerobic capacity), mostly likely due to exercise and boosted by taurine supplementation. No changes in BDNF levels were observed (p\u2009>\u20090.05), while NGF concentration were undetectable in almost subjects.

          "content": "Taurine has been proven to play a significant role in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, but its relationship with moyamoya disease (MMD) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between serum taurine levels and long-term adverse cerebrovascular events in patients with MMD after revascularization. This study involved 352 patients with MMD, from whom comprehensive clinical data and blood samples were collected. Serum taurine levels were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the relationship between serum taurine concentration and various blood indices was evaluated. Cerebrovascular adverse events included transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. Taurine, analyzed as a continuous variable, was found to predict a cut-off for postoperative cerebrovascular adverse events in MMD patients at 842.52\u00a0\u03bcmol/L. The impact of serum taurine levels on the risk of cerebrovascular events was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictive factors for postoperative prognosis. Grouping MMD patients by serum taurine levels revealed that higher taurine levels were significantly associated with a lower proportion of hemorrhagic MMD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.044). Compared with ischemic MMD, patients with hemorrhagic MMD had lower taurine concentrations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). KM curves showed that the incidence of postoperative cerebrovascular adverse events in the high taurine group was significantly lower than in the low taurine group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026). Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that higher taurine concentrations significantly reduced the risk of postoperative cerebrovascular adverse events (Hazard Ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.334, 95\u00a0% Confidence Interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.121-0.923, p\u00a0=\u00a00.035). Furthermore, the multivariate Cox regression model confirmed that taurine level is an independent predictor of long-term adverse cerebrovascular events, with the high concentration group showing a significantly reduced risk. Low serum taurine levels are associated with a higher risk of long-term adverse cerebrovascular events following MMD revascularization. This suggests the significant potential of serum taurine as a prognostic biomarker for postoperative outcomes. URL: https://www.chictr.org.cn/. Unique identifier: ChiCTR2200061889.",

          "content": "The purpose of this investigation was to describe the dynamics of carnitine metabolism during an acute episode of exercise. Twenty-eight subjects (14 male; 14 female) exercised for 40 min on a bicycle ergometer at 55% of their maximal aerobic capacities. Blood samples were obtained at rest, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min of exercise, and 15-min postexercise. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were performed before and after exercise. Results demonstrated that the percent of acylated plasma carnitine increased significantly (P less than 0.05) across all subjects from 17.3% at rest to 22.3% by 40 min of exercise and continued to increase to 22.8% 15-min postexercise. Total muscle carnitine levels fell significantly (P less than 0.001) across all subjects from 4.21 (1.27) (means +/- SD) mumol/g wet weight at rest to 3.29 (1.27) mumol/g wet weight after exercise. Well-trained males and females had almost identical levels of muscle carnitine [4.35(1.86) and 4.34 (0.64) mumol/g wet weight, respectively]. These levels were somewhat higher but not significantly higher than their moderately trained counterparts [3.86(1.34) and 4.28(1.18) males and females, respectively]. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase (E.C. 2.3.1.21) activity also declined significantly (P less than 0.05) across all subjects after exercise. This study is the first to demonstrate a potential loss of acylated carnitine forms from muscle to plasma during acute exercise, possibly reflecting an increase in carnitine turnover. Alterations in carnitine status may represent another metabolic adaptation to chronic exercise training.",

A quantity of 2 g of L-carnitine or a placebo were administered orally in random order to these subjects 1 h before they began exercise on a cycle ergometer. Exercise intensity was increased by 50-W increments every 3 min until they became exhausted. After 72-h recovery, the same exercise regime was repeated but this time the subjects, who had previously received L-carnitine, were now given the placebo and vice versa. The results showed that at the maximal exercise intensity, treatment with L-carnitine significantly increased both maximal oxygen uptake, and power output. Moreover, at similar exercise intensities in the L-carnitine trial oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, pulmonary ventilation and plasma lactate were reduced. It is concluded that under these experimental conditions pretreatment with L-carnitine favoured aerobic processes resulting in a more efficient performance. Possible mechanisms producing this effect are discussed.",

Two hours after administration, the subjects performed a constant-load exercise test (CET(1)) cycling at their individual anaerobic threshold to exhaustion.

Exercise induces health benefits, but acute exertion up-regulates oxidative stress responses in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on i) exercise performance and ii) blood redox status both at rest and after exercise. Twelve hemodialysis patients received either L-carnitine (20 mg kg(-1) i.v.) or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, and crossover design for 8 wk. Participants performed an exercise test to exhaustion before and after supplementation. During the test, V\u02d9O2, respiratory quotient, heart rate, and time to exhaustion were monitored. Blood samples, collected before and after exercise, were analyzed for lactate, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls, reduced and oxidized glutathione, antioxidant capacity, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity. Blood carnitine increased by L-carnitine supplementation proportionately at rest and after exercise. L-carnitine supplementation increased time to fatigue (22%) and decreased postexercise lactate (37%), submaximal heart rate, and respiratory quotient but did not affect V\u02d9O2peak. L-carnitine supplementation increased reduced/oxidized glutathione (2.7-fold at rest, 4-fold postexercise) and glutathione peroxidase activity (4.5% at rest, 10% postexercise) and decreased malondialdehyde (19% at rest and postexercise) and protein carbonyl (27% at rest, 40% postexercise) concentration.

The blood levels of estradiol, progesterone, total carnitine, free carnitine, and acylcarnitine were assessed. Compared with the FP, the LP had significantly lower serum total carnitine (p<0.05) and free carnitine (p<0.01). Moreover, the group with decreased endurance performance in the LP than in the FP showed a significantly higher change in serum free carnitine compared with the group that showed improved endurance performance in the LP than in the FP (p<0.05).

A double-blind clinical study was performed in ten Italian intensive care units on 115 patients with septic, cardiac of traumatic shock, by using acetyl-L-carnitine infusion for 12 hours, with a previous single bolus intravenously. The results showed a good response to the drug in terms of blood oxygenation during the course of sepsis and heart failure.

Measurements were made on venous blood samples collected during each experiment at fixed time intervals over an initial rest of 45 min, 60 min bicycle exercise performed near 50% VO2max and 120 min recovery. Free and total plasma carnitine levels reached a plateau corresponding to an average rise of 25% for both fractions, 9-10 days after the beginning of the L-carn diet. These levels returned to their initial values 6-8 weeks after cessation of the supply. Generally L-carn supplementation did not significantly modify the physiological parameters and circulating metabolites. No distinct increase of the relative participation of endogenous lipids in the fuel supply of prolonged submaximal exercise was observed. In normal human subjects the increased demand for fatty acid oxidation resulting from exercise seems to be adequately supported by endogenous levels of carnitine.",

Seven moderately trained human male subjects serving as their own controls participated in two bicycle exercise sessions (120 min, 50% of VO2max). The second exercise was preceded by 5 days of oral carnitine supplementation (CS; 5 g daily). Despite a doubling of plasma carnitine levels, with CS, there were no effects on exercise-induced changes in arterial levels and turnover of FFA, the relation between leg FFA inflow and FFA uptake, or the leg exchange of other substrates. Heart rate during exercise after CS decreased 7-8%, but O2 uptake was unchanged. Exercise before CS induced a fall from 33.4 +/- 1.6 to 30.8 +/- 1.0 (SE) mumol/l in free plasma carnitine despite a release (2.5 +/- 0.9 mumol/min) from the leg. Simultaneously, acylated plasma carnitine rose from 5.0 +/- 1.0 to 14.2 +/- 1.4 mumol/l, with no evidence of leg release. Consequently, total plasma carnitine increased. We concluded that in healthy subjects CS does not influence muscle substrate utilization either at rest or during prolonged exercise and that free carnitine released from muscle during exercise is presumably acylated in the liver and released to plasma.",

Triglycerides were evaluated by a fat feeding (90 g fat) and 3 h later subjects cycled for 60 min at 70% VO2max (CON). Muscle biopsies were obtained preexercise and after 30 and 60 min of EX. Blood samples were taken prior to and every 15 min of exercise. Subjects randomly completed two additional trials following 7 and 14 d of carnitine supplementation (6 g.d-1). During one of the two trials, subjects received 2000 units of heparin 15 min prior to EX to elevate FFA (CNhep); no heparin was administered during the other trial (CN). There were no differences in VO2, respiratory exchange ratio, heart rate, or g.min-1 of CHO and fat oxidized among the three trials. At rest serum total acid soluble (TASC) and free (FC) carnitine increased with supplementation (TASC; CON, 71.3 +/- 2.9; CN, 92.8 +/- 5.4; CNhep, 109.8 +/- 3.5 mumol.l-1) (FC; CON, 44.1 +/- 2.7; CN, 66.1 +/- 5.3; CNhep, 77.1 +/- 4.1 mumol.l-1). During EX, TASC remained stable, while FC decreased and short-chain acylcarnitine (SCAC) increased (P < 0.05). Muscle carnitine concentration at rest was unaffected by supplementation. During EX, muscle TASC did not change, FC decreased, and SCAC increased significantly in all three trials. Pre-EX and post-EX muscle glycogens were not different. Increased availability of serum carnitine does not result in an increase in muscle carnitine content nor does it alter lipid oxidation. It appears that there is an adequate amount of carnitine present within the mitochondria to support lipid oxidation.",

          "title": "L-carnitine supplementation in patients with advanced cancer and carnitine deficiency: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.",
          "content": "Carnitine deficiency is prevalent in populations with chronic illness, including cancer. In a recent open-label study, L-carnitine supplementation was well tolerated and appeared to improve fatigue and other outcomes in cancer patients. To further evaluate this finding, adult patients with advanced cancer, carnitine deficiency (free carnitine more than 35 micromol/L for males or less than 25 micromol/L for females, or acyl/free carnitine ratio of more than 0.4), moderate to severe fatigue, and a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of 50 or more, were randomly assigned to receive either L-carnitine (0.5 g/day for two days, followed by 1g/day for two days, and then 2g/day for 10 days) or placebo. This double-blind phase was followed by an open-label phase, during which all patients received L-carnitine supplementation for two weeks. Outcomes included the fatigue subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An), the Linear Analog Scale Assessments (LASA), the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and the KPS. Twenty-nine patients (12 placebo, 17 L-carnitine) were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. From baseline to the end of the double-blind phase, serum total and free L-carnitine increased from 32.9+/-3.8 to 56.6+/-20.5 (P=0.004), and from 22.9+/-19.4 to 45.3+/-17.2 (P=0.004), respectively, in the L-carnitine-treated group, and from 28.2+/-10.2 to 36.2+/-8.7 (P=ns), and from 22.6+/-7.9 to 28.7+/-8.6 (P=ns) in the placebo group, respectively. The planned ITT analysis revealed no significant improvement in any of the study's endpoints, and these negative findings were not different when data from two patients who did not adhere to the protocol were eliminated. However, an exploratory covariate analysis that excluded these two protocol violators and included outcome data from both the double-blind and open-label phases demonstrated significantly improved fatigue on the FACT-An fatigue subscale (P<0.03), and significantly improved FACT-An functional well-being subscale (P<0.03), and KPS (P<0.003), in the group that started with L-carnitine during the double-blind phase. These data do not support the conclusion that L-carnitine in the doses tested reverses cancer-related fatigue in carnitine-deficient patients. However, L-carnitine supplementation does increase L-carnitine serum levels, and the positive findings in an exploratory analysis justify a larger study to determine if this strategy could be of benefit for a subpopulation of cancer patients.",

Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: placebo (n=9), 1 g/d GPLC (n=11), or 3 g/d GPLC (n=12), in a double-blind fashion. Muscle carnitine (vastus lateralis), VO(2peak), exercise time to fatigue, anaerobic threshold, anaerobic power, and total work were measured at baseline and after an 8-wk aerobic-training program. There were no statistical differences (p> .05) between or within the 3 groups for any performance-related variable or muscle carnitine concentrations after 8 wk of supplementation and training. These results suggest that up to 3 g/d GPLC for 8 wk in conjunction with aerobic-exercise training is ineffective for increasing muscle carnitine content and has no significant effects on aerobic- or anaerobic-exercise performance.",

Two groups of healthy, untrained subjects were studied in double-blind cross-over trails. Oral supplementation of 2 g per day L-carnitine was used for 2 weeks in the first trial and the same dose but for 4 weeks in the second trial. Maximum and submaximum exercise capacity were assessed during a continuous progressive cycle ergometer exercise test performed at 70 rpm. In trial 1, plasma concentrations of lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate were measured pre- and post-exercise. In trial 2, pre- and post-exercise plasma lactate were measured. The results of treatment with L-carnitine demonstrated no significant changes in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) or in maximum heart rate. In trial 1, there was a small improvement in submaximal performance as evidenced by a decrease in the heart-rate response to a work-load requiring 50% of VO2max. The more extensive trial 2 did not reproduce the significant result obtained in trial 1, that is, there was no significant decrease in heart rate at any given submaximal exercise intensity, under carnitine-supplemented conditions. Plasma metabolic concentrations were unchanged following L-carnitine, in both trials. It is concluded, that in contrast to other reports, carnitine supplementation may be of little benefit to exercise performance since the observed effects were small and inconsistent.",

          "content": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a common and devastating neuropsychiatric complication of acute liver failure or chronic liver disease. Ammonia content in the blood seems to play a role in the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment for hepatic encephalopathy is complex. Acetyl-L-carnitine is a substance that may reduce ammonia toxicity. This review assessed the benefits and harms of acetyl-L-carnitine for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. To assess the benefits and harms of acetyl-L-carnitine for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded for randomised clinical trials. We sought additional randomised clinical trials from the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We performed all electronic searches until 10 September 2018. We looked through the reference lists of retrieved publications and review articles, and we searched the FDA and EMA websites. We searched for randomised clinical trials in any setting, recruiting people with hepatic encephalopathy. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared acetyl-L-carnitine plus standard care (e.g. antibiotics, lactulose) versus placebo or no acetyl-L-carnitine plus standard care. We are well aware that by selecting randomised clinical trials, we placed greater focus on potential benefits than on potential harms. We selected randomised clinical trials, assessed risk of bias in eight domains, and extracted data in a duplicate and independent fashion. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using I\u00b2 and D\u00b2 statistics. We subjected our analyses to fixed-effect and random-effects model meta-analyses. We assessed bias risk domains to control systematic errors. We assessed overall quality of the data for each individual outcome by using the GRADE approach. We identified five randomised clinical trials involving 398 participants. All trials included only participants with cirrhosis as the underlying cause of hepatic encephalopathy. Trials included participants with covert or overt hepatic encephalopathy. All trials were conducted in Italy by a single team and assessed acetyl-L-carnitine compared with placebo. Oral intervention was the most frequent route of administration. All trials were at high risk of bias and were underpowered. None of the trials were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.None of the identified trials reported information on all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, or days of hospitalisation. Only one trial assessed quality of life using the Short Form (SF)-36 scale (67 participants; very low-quality evidence). The effects of acetyl-L-carnitine compared with placebo on general health at 90 days are uncertain (MD -6.20 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.51 to -2.89). Results for additional domains of the SF-36 are also uncertain. One trial assessed fatigue using the Wessely and Powell test (121 participants; very low-quality evidence). The effects are uncertain in people with moderate-grade hepatic encephalopathy (mental fatigue: MD 0.40 points, 95% CI -0.21 to 1.01; physical fatigue: MD -0.20 points, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.52) and mild-grade hepatic encephalopathy (mental fatigue: -0.80 points, 95% CI -1.48 to -0.12; physical fatigue: 0.20 points, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.12). Meta-analysis showed a reduction in blood ammonium levels favouring acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo (MD -13.06 mg/dL, 95% CI -17.24 to -8.99; 387 participants; 5 trials; very low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo increases the risk of non-serious adverse events (8/126 (6.34%) vs 3/120 (2.50%); RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.68 to 9.22; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). Overall, adverse events data were poorly reported and harms may have been underestimated. This Cochrane systematic review analysed a heterogeneous group of five trials at high risk of bias and with high risk of random errors conducted by only one research team. We assessed acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo in participants with cirrhosis with covert or overt hepatic encephalopathy. Hence, we have no data on the drug for hepatic encephalopathy in acute liver failure. We found no information about all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, or days of hospitalisation. We found no clear differences in effect between acetyl-L-carnitine and placebo regarding quality of life, fatigue, and non-serious adverse events. Acetyl-L-carnitine reduces blood ammonium levels compared with placebo. We rated all evidence as of very low quality due to pitfalls in design and execution, inconsistency, small sample sizes, and very few events. The harms profile for acetyl-L-carnitine is presently unclear. Accordingly, we need further randomised clinical trials to assess acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo conducted according to the SPIRIT statements and reported according to the CONSORT statements.",

          "content": "Athletes often take sport supplements to reduce fatigue and immune disturbances during or after training. This study evaluated the acute effects of concurrent ingestion of alkaline water and L-glutamine on the salivary immunity and hormone responses of boxers after training. Twelve male boxing athletes were recruited in this study. During regular training, the participants were randomly divided into three groups and asked to consume 400 mL of alkaline water (Group A), 0.15 g/kg body weight of L-glutamine with 400 mL of water (Group G), and 0.15 g/kg of L-glutamine with 400 mL of alkaline water (Group A+G) at the same time each day for three consecutive weeks. Before and immediately after the training, saliva, heart rates, and the rate of perceived exertion were investigated. The activity of \u03b1-amylase and concentrations of lactoferrin, immunoglobulin A (IgA), testosterone, and cortisol in saliva were measured. The results showed that the ratio of \u03b1-amylase activity/total protein (TP) significantly increased after training in Group A+G but not in Group A or G, whereas the ratios of lactoferrin/TP and IgA/TP were unaffected in all three groups. The concentrations of salivary testosterone after training increased significantly in Group A+G but not in Group A or G, whereas the salivary cortisol concentrations were unaltered in all groups. In conclusion, concurrent ingestion of 400 mL of alkaline water and 0.15 g/kg of L-glutamine before training enhanced the salivary \u03b1-amylase activity and testosterone concentration of boxers, which would be beneficial for post-exercise recovery.",

          "content": "There is an increased risk of infections in athletes undertaking prolonged, strenuous exercise. There is also some evidence that cells of the immune system are less able to mount a defence against infections after such exercise. The level of plasma glutamine, an important fuel for cells of the immune system, is decreased in athletes after endurance exercise; this may be partly responsible for the apparent immunosuppression which occurs in these individuals. We monitored levels of infection in more than 200 runners and towers. The levels of infection were lowest in middle-distance runners, and highest in runners after a full or ultramarathon and in elite rowers after intensive training. In the present study, athletes participating in different types of exercise consumed two drinks, containing either glutamine (Group G) or placebo (Group P) immediately after and 2 h after exercise. They subsequently completed questionnaires (n = 151) about the incidence of infections during the 7 days following the exercise. The percentage of athletes reporting no infections was considerably higher in Group G (81%, n = 72) than in Group P (49%, n = 79, p < 0.001).",

          "content": "Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in human muscle and plasma and is utilised at high rates by rapidly dividing cells, including leucocytes, to provide energy and optimal conditions for nucleotide biosynthesis. As such, it is considered to be essential for proper immune function. During various catabolic states including surgical trauma, infection, starvation and prolonged exercise, glutamine homeostasis is placed under stress. Falls in the plasma glutamine level (normal range 500 to 750 mumol/L after an overnight fast) have been reported following endurance events and prolonged exercise. These levels remain unchanged or temporarily elevated after short term, high intensity exercise. Plasma glutamine has also been reported to fall in patients with untreated diabetes mellitus, in diet-induced metabolic acidosis and in the recovery period following high intensity intermittent exercise. Common factors among all these stress states are rises in the plasma concentrations of cortisol and glucagon and an increased tissue requirement for glutamine for gluconeogenesis. It is suggested that increased gluconeogenesis and associated increases in hepatic, gut and renal glutamine uptake account for the depletion of plasma glutamine in catabolic stress states, including prolonged exercise. The short term effects of exercise on the plasma glutamine level may be cumulative, since heavy training has been shown to result in low plasma glutamine levels (< 500 mumol/L) requiring long periods of recovery. Furthermore, athletes experiencing discomfort from the overtraining syndrome exhibit lower resting levels of plasma glutamine than active healthy controls. Therefore, physical activity directly affects the availability of glutamine to the leucocytes and thus may influence immune function. The utility of plasma glutamine level as a marker of overtraining has recently been highlighted, but a consensus has not yet been reached concerning the best method of determining the level. Since injury, infection, nutritional status and acute exercise can all influence plasma glutamine level, these factors must be controlled and/or taken into consideration if plasma glutamine is to prove a useful marker of impending overtraining.",

          "content": "Glutamine is an essential substrate for the proper functioning of cells of the immune system. Falls in plasma glutamine concentration after exercise may have deleterious consequences for immune cell function and render the individual more susceptible to infection. The purpose of the present study was to examine changes in plasma glutamine concentration (measured using a validated enzymatic spectrophotometric method) following an acute bout of intermittent high-intensity exercise. Eight well-trained male games players took part in the study. Subjects reported to the laboratory following an overnight fast and performed a 1-h cycle exercise task consisting of 20 1-min periods at 100% maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) each separated by 2 min of recovery at 30% VO2max. Venous blood samples were taken before exercise and at 5 min, 1 h, 2.5 h, 5 h and 24 h post-exercise. Glutamine was measured by enzymatic spectrophotometric determination of the ammonia concentration before and after treatment of the plasma with glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2). Plasma glutamine concentration did not fall in the immediate post-exercise period [pre-exercise 681 (23) microM compared with 663 (46) microM at 5 min post-exercise, mean (SEM)], but fell to 572 (35) microM at 5 h post-exercise (P < 0.05 compared with pre-exercise). Plasma lactate concentration rose to 8.8 (1.0) mM at the end of exercise and fell to 1.8 (0.4) mM at 1 h post-exercise, but plasma concentrations of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate both rose substantially in the post-exercise period (to 240% and 400% of pre-exercise levels, respectively). The circulating leucocyte count increased significantly during exercise (P < 0.01), continued to increase in the hours following exercise and peaked at 2.5 h post-exercise (mainly due to a neutrophilia). The fall in the plasma glutamine concentration at 5 h post-exercise could be due to increased renal uptake of glutamine, which generally occurs in conditions of metabolic acidosis or due to a greater removal of glutamine from the plasma resulting from the elevated circulating leucocyte count.",

          "content": "The distinction between positive and negative training adaptation is an important prerequisite in the identification of any marker for monitoring training in athletes. To investigate the glutamine responses to progressive endurance training, twenty healthy males were randomly assigned to a training group or a non-exercising control group. The training group performed a progressive (3 to 6 x 90 minute sessions per week at 70 % V.O (2max)) six-week endurance training programme on a cycle ergometer, while the control group did not participate in any exercise during this period. Performance assessments (V.O (2max) and time to exhaustion) and resting blood samples (for haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, cortisol, ferritin, creatine kinase, glutamine, uric acid and urea analysis) were obtained prior to the commencement of training (Pre) and at the end of week 2, week 4 and week 6. The training group showed significant improvements in time to exhaustion (p < 0.01), and V.O (2max) (p < 0.05) at all time points (except week 2 for V.O (2max)), while the control group performance measures did not change. In the training group, haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than pretraining values at week 2 and 4, as percentage changes in plasma volume indicated a significant (p < 0.01) haemodilution (+ 6 - 9 %) was present at week 2, 4 and 6. No changes were seen in the control group. In the training group, plasma glutamine (week 2, 4 and 6), creatine kinase (week 2 and 4), uric acid (week 2 and 4) and urea (week 2 and 4) all increased significantly from pretraining levels. No changes in cortisol or ferritin were found in the training group and no changes in any blood variables were present in the control group. Plasma glutamine was the only blood variable to remain significantly above pretraining (966 +/- 32 micromol . 1 (-1)) levels at week 6 (1176 +/- 24 micromol . 1 (-1); p < 0.05) The elevation seen here in glutamine levels, after 6 weeks of progressive endurance training, is in contrast to previous reports of decreased glutamine concentrations in overtrained athletes. In conclusion, 6 weeks of progressive endurance training steadily increased plasma glutamine levels, which may prove useful in the monitoring of training responses.",

The purpose of this investigation was to study the effects of a 60-min bout of vigorous treadmill running with dietary manipulation on plasma concentrations of glutamine, FTrp and BCAA after an exercise and diet regime designed to reduce muscle glycogen. Seven male distance runners [mean (SD) age: 29.3 (2.1) years; VO2max: 62.7 (3.3) ml.kg-1.min-1] acted as subjects. Each undertook a regime designed to reduce muscle glycogen, then performed a 60-min treadmill run (75% VO2max) under two dietary conditions: after a 14-h fast (fasted) and after ingestion of a high carbohydrate meal (30 kJ.kg-1: 80% carbohydrate, 10% protein, 10% fat) 3 h before running (fed). Plasma concentrations of glutamine, FTrp, BCAA, free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol and glucose were measured 5 min before and 5 min after the run, under each dietary condition. Plasma glutamine did not change in response to exercise when fasted (P > 0.05), but increased when fed (P = 0.007). Plasma FTrp increased under both dietary conditions (P < 0.001), but the magnitude of this increase was greater when fasted than when fed (P < 0.001). Plasma BCAA did not change under either dietary condition (P < 0.05). Increases in the plasma FTrp/BCAA ratio reflected increases in plasma FFA and glycerol concentrations (P < 0.001; both dietary conditions) and these changes were all greater under fasted conditions when a fall in blood glucose concentration was observed (P = 0.007). These data emphasise the importance of dietary carbohydrate intake between repeated bouts of prolonged exercise on responses of plasma glutamine, FTrp and BCAA during subsequent exercise.",

Dependent measures were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of resistance training. Both groups significantly improved MS and ME while the supplement group significantly increased body weight and fat-free mass. Control decreased body fat and increased fat-free mass. This study demonstrated that the supplement group did not enhance MS, ME, or BC significantly more than control after an 8-week resistance-training program.",

          "content": "This study examined the influence of a triathlon on the immune system and on serum amino acid concentrations. Eight male triathletes swam 2500 m, bicycled 81 km, and ran 19 km. The concentration of total serum amino acids decreased during the race, with the lowest values occurring 2 h postexercise. Similarly, serum glutamine concentration declined from 468 (SEM 24) (prerace) to 318 (SEM 20) mumol-1 (2 h postrace) and the natural killer (NK) and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cell activities were suppressed 2 h postexercise (P < 0.05). Blood mononuclear cell proliferation decreased during exercise with the lowest value observed after running. The leucocyte concentration increased during and after exercise due to an increase in the concentration of neutrophils and monocytes. There was no significant change in lymphocyte concentration during or after the exercise. The plasma concentration of interleukin-6 did not change and the plasma concentration of interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were below detection limits. The LAK cell cytotoxicity, but not NK cell activity or proliferative response, was significantly correlated with serum glutamine concentrations (r = 0.39, P < 0.01). This study confirms that prolonged endurance exercise results in changes in the cytotoxic function of the NK and LAK cells as well as the proliferative response. The time-course of changes in serum glutamine concentrations were best parallelled by changes in LAK cell activities.",

          "content": "Recent studies have shown that neutrophils can utilize glutamine and that glutamine supplementation can improve neutrophil function in postoperative and burn patients. The present study investigated the influence of oral glutamine supplementation on stimulated neutrophil degranulation and oxidative burst activity following prolonged exercise. Subjects, 7 well-trained men, reported to the laboratory following an overnight fast and cycled for 2 hrs at 60% VO2max on two occasions a week apart. They were randomly assigned to either a glutamine or placebo treatment. For both trials, subjects consumed a sugar-free lemon drink at 15-min intervals until 90 minutes, then a lemon flavored glutamine drink (GLN) or sugar-free lemon drink (PLA) was consumed at 15-min intervals for the remaining exercise and the 2-hr recovery period. Venous blood samples were taken pre-, during, and postexercise. Glutamine supplementation had no effect on the magnitude of postexercise leukocytosis, the plasma elastase concentration following exercise (which increased in both trials), or the plasma elastase release in response to bacterial stimulation (which fell in both trials). Neutrophil function assessed by oxidative burst activity of isolated cells did not change following exercise in either trial. These findings therefore suggest that the fall in plasma glutamine concentration does not account for the decrease in neutrophil function (degranulation response) following prolonged exercise.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence was conducted to obtain a conclusive result on the effects of glutamine supplementation on athletes. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data related to body mass, lean body mass, body fat percentage, Vo2 max, lymphocytes, leukocytes and neutrophil counts were extracted to determine the effects of GLN on performance outcomes. The literature search was conducted across the databases Pubmed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, SID (Scientific Information Database) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, covering a period up to January 2017. Clinical trials evaluating glutamine supplementation outcomes on athletes aged over 18 were included. A total of 47 studies were included in the systematic review, and 25 trials matched the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. According to the meta-analysis, glutamine has a significant effect on weight reduction (WMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.36 [95% CI:\u00a0-2.55 to\u00a0-0.16], p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Moreover, neutrophil numbers were reduced following glutamine intake at doses greater than 200\u00a0mg/kg body weight (WMD\u00a0=\u00a0-605.77 [95% CI:\u00a0-1200.0 to 52.1]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Also, supplementation by glutamine dipeptide resulted in higher blood glucose after exercise (WMD\u00a0=\u00a00.51 [95% CI: 0.18, 0.83] mmol/l; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). There was no association between glutamine ingestion and other outcomes investigated. According to this meta-analysis, generally, glutamine supplementation has no effect on athletics immune system, aerobic performance, and body composition. However, the current study showed that glutamine resulted in greater weight reduction. In addition, the present study suggests that the efficacy of glutamine supplementation on neutrophil numbers could be affected by supplement type and dose.",

          "content": "This study examined the relationship between muscle glutamine, muscle glycogen, and plasma glutamine concentrations over 3 d of high-intensity exercise during which dietary carbohydrate (CHO) intake varied. Five endurance-trained men completed two exercise trials in randomized order, over a 14-d period. Each trial required subjects to perform 50 min of high-intensity continuous and interval exercise on three consecutive days while consuming a diet that provided 45% of the energy as CHO or a diet in which CHO provided 70% of the total energy. Four days of inactivity and consumption of a 55% CHO diet separated the two randomized trials. Menus and food were provided for the subjects and all food and drink consumed were weighed and recorded for later analysis. Before exercise on the first day of each trial, at the start of exercise on day 3 and on completion of exercise on day 3, muscle was biopsied from the vastus lateralis for the analysis of glutamine and glycogen concentrations. Venous blood was sampled before and twice after exercise on each day for the analysis of plasma glutamine and cortisol concentrations. Mean plasma glutamine concentration was significantly higher during the 70% CHO exercise trial when compared with the 45% CHO trial (P < 0.05). Glycogen decreased by the same magnitude during both trials and there was no relationship between changes in plasma glutamine and changes in muscle glycogen concentration. Muscle glutamine concentration did not change in either trial. These data suggest that the influence of carbohydrate intake upon the concentration of plasma glutamine is not mediated through the concentration of intramuscular glycogen.",

          "content": "Oral glutamine supplementation during and after exercise abolishes exercise-induced decreases in plasma glutamine concentration but does not affect secretory IgA (sIgA) salivary output. Whether chronic glutamine supplementation during high-intensity interval training influences salivary and nasal sIgA concentration is unknown. The purpose of this study was examine the effects of chronic glutamine supplementation on sIgA during intense running training. Runners (n = 13, body mass 69.9 +/- 2.8 kg, peak whole body oxygen uptake 55.5 +/- 2 ml.kg(-1).min(-1), age 29.1 +/- 2.8 yr) participated in twice-daily interval training for 9-9.5 days, followed by recovery (5-7 days). Oral glutamine supplement (0.1 g/kg) or placebo was given four times daily for the first 14 days. After an overnight fast, venous blood, nasal washes, and stimulated saliva were collected at baseline (T1), midtraining (T2), posttraining (T3), and after recovery (T4). Mood states were assessed by using Profile of Mood States (POMS) inventories. We found that glutamine concentration in resting subjects decreased from T1 to T4 (P < 0.05) and was not altered by supplementation. Salivary IgA concentration and output were unchanged by training or supplementation. Mean nasal IgA across the study period was greater in runners receiving glutamine (264.7 +/- 35.0 microg/mg protein) vs. placebo (172.4 +/- 33.7 microg/mg protein; P < 0.05). POMS analyses indicated that vigor was lower at T3 vs. T1 (P < 0.05) and fatigue was higher at T2 vs. T1 and T4 (P < 0.05). We conclude that chronic glutamine supplementation during interval training results in higher nasal IgA than placebo but does not affect salivary IgA concentration or output.",

UK Biobank, a prospective study involving 22 recruitment centers across the United Kingdom. For this analysis, we included 266,840 participants from the UK Biobank who had available BCAA data and no history of MACE at baseline. Cox regression analysis was conducted to evaluate these associations, adjusting for potential confounders. During a 13.80 \u00b1 0.83-year follow-up, 52,598 participants experienced MACE, with the incidence of MACE increasing progressively across quintiles of circulating BCAAs, isoleucine, leucine, and valine. Overall, the fifth quintile exhibited a 7-12% higher MACE risk compared to the second quintile. In males, BCAAs were not associated with MACE risk. However, increased risks were observed for isoleucine (8-12% in higher quintiles), leucine (9% in the first quintile and 6% in the fifth quintile), and valine (8% in the first quintile). In females, higher quintiles of BCAAs, isoleucine, leucine, and valine were associated with increased MACE risk, ranging from 9% to 12%. Among participants under 65y, higher quintiles of BCAAs, isoleucine, and leucine were associated with increased MACE risk, while valine showed no significant association. No association was found in participants aged 65 and older. These analyses were adjusted for multiple potential confounders. Generally, higher levels of BCAAs, isoleucine, leucine, and valine were associated with an increased risk of MACE, except in participants older than 65. Additionally, in males, the lowest quintiles of leucine and valine were also associated with an increased risk of MACE.",

          "content": "This study aimed to determine the effect of postexercise protein-leucine coingestion with CHO-lipid on subsequent high-intensity endurance performance and to investigate candidate mechanisms using stable isotope methods and metabolomics. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 male cyclists ingested a leucine/protein/CHO/fat supplement (LEUPRO 7.5/20/89/22 g \u00b7 h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric CHO/fat control (119/22 g \u00b7 h(-1)) 1-3 h after exercise during a 6-d training block (intense intervals, recovery, repeated-sprint performance rides). Daily protein intake was clamped at 1.9 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (LEUPRO) and 1.5 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (control). Stable isotope infusions (1-(13)C-leucine and 6,6-(2)H2-glucose), mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and nitrogen balance methods were used to determine the effects of LEUPRO on whole-body branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and glucose metabolism and protein turnover. After exercise, LEUPRO increased BCAA levels in plasma (2.6-fold; 90% confidence limits = \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and urine (2.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.2) and increased products of BCAA metabolism plasma acylcarnitine C5 (3.0-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 0.9) and urinary leucine (3.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.3) and \u03b2-aminoisobutyrate (3.4-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.4), indicating that ingesting ~10 g leucine per hour during recovery exceeds the capacity to metabolize BCAA. Furthermore, LEUPRO increased leucine oxidation (5.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and nonoxidative disposal (4.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and left leucine balance positive relative to control. With the exception of day 1 (LEUPRO = 17 \u00b1 20 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = -90 \u00b1 44 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)), subsequent (days 2-5) nitrogen balance was positive for both conditions (LEUPRO = 130 \u00b1 110 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = 111 \u00b1 86 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)). Compared with control feeding, LEUPRO lowered the serum creatine kinase concentration by 21%-25% (90% confidence limits = \u00b1 14%), but the effect on sprint power was trivial (day 4 = 0.4% \u00b1 1.0%, day 6 = -0.3% \u00b1 1.0%). Postexercise protein-leucine supplementation saturates BCAA metabolism and attenuates tissue damage, but effects on subsequent intense endurance performance may be inconsequential under conditions of positive daily nitrogen balance.",

We assessed whether ketone salts-caffeine-taurine-leucine (KCT) supplementation was superior to caffeine-free ketone salts-taurine-leucine supplementation (KT), or to an isoenergetic carbohydrate placebo (CHO-PLAC). Thirteen recreationally active men (mean \u00b1 SD: 177.5 \u00b1 6.1\u00a0cm, 75.9 \u00b1 4.6\u00a0kg, 23 \u00b1 3 years, 12.0 \u00b1 5.1% body fat) completed a best effort 20-km cycling time-trial, followed 15\u00a0min later by a Wingate power cycle test, after supplementing with either KCT (approximately 7\u00a0g of beta-hydroxybutyrate, approximately 120\u00a0mg of caffeine, 2.1\u00a0g of leucine, and 2.7\u00a0g of taurine), KT (i.e.,\u00a0same supplement without caffeine), or isoenergetic CHO-PLAC (11\u00a0g of dextrose). Blood ketones were elevated (p < .001) after ingestion of both KCT (0.65 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0mmol/L) and KT (0.72 \u00b1 0.31\u00a0mmol/L) relative to CHO-PLAC (0.06 \u00b1 0.05\u00a0mmol/L). Moreover, KCT improved (p < .003) 20-km cycling time-trial performance (37.80 \u00b1 2.28\u00a0min), compared with CHO-PLAC (39.40 \u00b1 3.33\u00a0min) but not versus KT (38.75 \u00b1 2.87\u00a0min; p < .09). 20-km cycling time-trial average power output was greater with KCT (power output = 180.5 \u00b1 28.7\u00a0W) versus both KT (170.9 \u00b1 31.7\u00a0W; p = .049) and CHO-PLAC (164.8 \u00b1 34.7\u00a0W; p = .001). Wingate peak power output was also greater for both KCT (1,134 \u00b1 137\u00a0W; p = .031) and KT (1,132 \u00b1 128\u00a0W; p = .039) versus CHO-PLAC (1,068 \u00b1 127\u00a0W). These data suggest that the observed improved exercise performance effects of this multi-ingredient supplement containing beta-hydroxybutyrate salts, taurine, and leucine are attributed partially to the addition of caffeine.",

To avoid this, resistance training has been proposed as an effective countermeasure, but the additional effect of a protein supplement is not so clear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a whey protein supplement enriched with leucine after resistance training on muscle mass and strength gains in a post-hospitalized elderly population. A total of 28 participants were included and allocated to either protein supplementation or placebo supplementation following resistance training for 12 weeks (2 days/week). Physical function (lower and upper body strength, aerobic capacity and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test), mini nutritional assessment (MNA) and body composition (Dual X-ray Absorptiometry) were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of resistance training. Both groups showed improvements in physical function after the intervention ( < 0.01), but there were no further effects for the protein group ( > 0.05). Muscle mass did not improve after resistance training in either group ( > 0.05). In conclusion, 12 weeks of resistance training are enough to improve physical function in a post-hospitalized elderly population with no further benefits for the protein-supplemented group.",

          "content": "Background: In patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS), lifestyle interventions combining diet, in particular, and physical exercise are recommended as the first line treatment. Previous studies have suggested that leucine or arginine supplementation may have beneficial effects on the body composition or insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, respectively. We thus conducted a randomized controlled study to evaluate the effects of a supervised adapted physical activity program associated or not with oral supplementation with leucine and arginine in MetS-complicated patients with obesity. Methods: Seventy-nine patients with obesity and MetS were randomized in four groups: patients receiving arginine and leucine supplementation (ALs group, n = 20), patients on a supervised adapted physical activity program (APA group, n = 20), patients combining ALs and APA (ALs+APA group, n = 20), and a control group (n = 19). After the baseline evaluation (m0), patients received ALs and/or followed the APA program for 6 months (m6). Body composition, MetS parameters, lipid and glucose metabolism markers, inflammatory markers, and a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) were assessed at m0, m6, and after a 3-month wash-out period (m9). Results: After 6 months of intervention, we did not observe variable changes in body weight, body composition, lipid and glucose metabolism markers, inflammatory parameters, or quality of life scores between the four groups. However, during the CPET, the maximal power (Pmax and Ppeak), power, and O2 consumption at the ventilatory threshold (P(VT) and O2(VT)) were improved in the APA and ALs+APA groups (p < 0.05), as well as the forced vital capacity (FVC). Between m6 and m9, a gain in fat mass was only observed in patients in the APA and ALs+APA groups. Conclusion: In our randomized controlled trial, arginine and leucine supplementation failed to improve MetS in patients with obesity, as did the supervised adapted physical activity program and the combination of both. Only the cardiorespiratory parameters were improved by exercise training.",

Dileucine (DILEU), a LEU-LEU dipeptide, increases MPS rates, however its impact on resistance training outcomes remains unexplored. This study assessed the effects of DILEU supplementation on resistance training adaptations. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled approach, 34 resistance-trained males (age: 28.3 \u00b1 5.9 years) consumed 2 grams of either DILEU monohydrate (RAMPS\u2122, Ingenious Ingredients, L.P.), LEU, or placebo (PLA) while following a 4-day per week resistance training program for 10 weeks. Changes in body composition, 1-repetition maximum (1RM) and repetitions to failure (RTF) for leg press (LP) and bench press (BP), anaerobic capacity, countermovement jump (CMJ), and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) were assessed after 0 and 10 weeks. Significant main effects for time (p < 0.001) were realized for LP and BP 1RM and RTF. A significant group \u00d7 time interaction was identified for changes in LP 1RM (p = 0.02) and LP RTF (p = 0.03). Greater increases in LP 1RM were observed in DILEU compared to PLA (p = 0.02; 95% CI: 5.8, 73.2 kg), and greater increases in LP RTF in DILEU compared to LEU (p = 0.04; 95% CI: 0.58, 20.3 reps). No significant differences were found in other measures. DILEU supplementation at 2 grams daily enhanced lower body strength and muscular endurance in resistance-trained males more effectively than LEU or PLA. These findings suggest DILEU as a potentially effective supplement for improving adaptations to resistance training. NCT06121869 retrospectively registered.",

          "content": "Leucine, isoleucine and valine, the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), make up about one-third of muscle protein. Of these, leucine has been the most thoroughly investigated because its oxidation rate is higher than that of isoleucine or valine. Leucine also stimulates protein synthesis in muscle and is closely associated with the release of gluconeogenic precursors, such as alanine, from muscle. Significant decreases in plasma or serum levels of leucine occur following aerobic (11 to 33%), anaerobic lactic (5 to 8%) and strength exercise (30%) sessions. In skeletal muscle, there is a decrease in leucine level and a reduction in glycogen stores during exhaustive aerobic exercise. Basal fasting serum leucine levels decrease by 20% during 5 weeks of speed and strength training in power-trained athletes on a daily protein intake of 1.26 g/kg bodyweight. The leucine content of protein is assumed to vary between 5 and 10%. There are suggestions that the current recommended dietary intake of leucine be increased from 14 mg/kg bodyweight/day to a minimum of 45 mg/kg bodyweight/day for sedentary individuals, and more for those participating in intensive training in order to optimise rates of whole body protein synthesis. Consumption of BCAA (30 to 35% leucine) before or during endurance exercise may prevent or decrease the net rate of protein degradation, may improve both mental and physical performance and may have a sparing effect on muscle glycogen degradation and depletion of muscle glycogen stores. However, leucine supplementation (200 mg/kg bodyweight) 50 minutes before anaerobic running exercise had no effect on performance. During 5 weeks of strength and speed training, leucine supplementation of 50 mg/kg bodyweight/day, supplementary to a daily protein intake of 1.26 g/kg bodyweight/day, appeared to prevent the decrease in the serum leucine levels in power-trained athletes. According to 1 study, dietary supplementation of the leucine metabolite beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) 3 g/day to humans undertaking intensive resistance training exercise resulted in an increased deposition of fat-free mass and an accompanying increase in strength. Muscle proteolysis was also decreased with HMB, accompanied by lower plasma levels of enzymes indicating muscle damage and an average 50% decrease in plasma essential amino acid levels. Furthermore, BCAA supplementation (76% leucine) in combination with moderate energy restriction has been shown to induce significant and preferential losses of visceral adipose tissue and to allow maintenance of a high level of performance. Caution must be paid when interpreting the limited number of studies in this area since, in many studies, leucine has been supplemented as part of a mixture of BCAA. Consequently, further research into the effects of leucine supplementation alone is needed.",

          "content": "Older adults are at increased risk of being bedridden and experiencing negative health outcomes including the loss of muscle tissue and functional capacity. We hypothesized that supplementing daily meals with a small quantity (3-4 g/meal) of leucine would partially preserve lean leg mass and function of older adults during bed rest. During a 7-day bed rest protocol, followed by 5 days of inpatient rehabilitation, healthy older men and women (67.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 yr, 14 men; 6 women) were randomized to receive isoenergetic meals supplemented with leucine (LEU, 0.06 g/kg/meal;  = 10) or an alanine control (CON, 0.06 g/kg/meal;  = 10). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, following bed rest, and after rehabilitation. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Functional capacity was assessed by knee extensor isokinetic and isometric dynamometry, peak aerobic capacity, and the short physical performance battery. Muscle fiber type, cross-sectional area, signaling protein expression levels, and single fiber characteristics were determined from biopsies of the vastus lateralis. Leucine supplementation reduced the loss of leg lean mass during bed rest (LEU vs. CON: -423 vs. -1035\u2009\u00b1\u2009143 g;  = 0.008) but had limited impact on strength or endurance-based functional outcomes. Similarly, leucine had no effect on markers of anabolic signaling and protein degradation during bed rest or rehabilitation. In conclusion, providing older adults with supplemental leucine has minimal impact on total energy or protein consumption and has the potential to partially counter some, but not all, of the negative effects of inactivity on muscle health. Skeletal muscle morphology and function in older adults was significantly compromised by 7 days of disuse. Leucine supplementation partially countered the loss of lean leg mass but did not preserve muscle function or positively impact changes at the muscle fiber level associated with bed rest or rehabilitation. Of note, our data support a relationship between myonuclear content and adaptations to muscle atrophy at the whole limb and single fiber level.",

The Liverpool Hope University-Sarcopenia Aging Trial (LHU-SAT) was a 16\u00a0week RCT (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02912130) of 100 community-dwelling older adults [mean age: 68.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.80\u00a0years, body mass index: 27.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.18\u00a0kg/m (52% women)] who were randomized to four independent groups [Control (C), Exercise (E), Exercise\u00a0+\u00a0Protein (EP), Protein (P)]. E and EP completed supervised and progressive resistance-based exercise (resistance exercise: two times per week, functional circuit exercise: once per week), while EP and P were supplemented with a leucine-enriched whey protein drink (three times per day) based on individual body weight (0.50\u00a0g/kg/meal, 1.50\u00a0g/kg/day). Outcome measures including arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity), fasting plasma/serum biomarkers [glucose/glycated haemoglobin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, insulin, resistin, leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, cystatin-C, & ferritin], insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and kidney function (eGFR) were measured before and after intervention. Total protein intake (habitual diet plus supplementation) increased to 1.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.69\u00a0g/kg/day in EP and to 1.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.72\u00a0g/kg/day in P, and remained significantly lower (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in unsupplemented groups (E: 1.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0g/kg/day, C: 1.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26\u00a0g/kg/day). At 16\u00a0weeks, there was a group-by-time interaction whereby absolute changes in LDL-cholesterol were lower in EP [mean difference: -0.79\u00a0mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.29, -0.28, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002] and P (mean difference: -0.76\u00a0mmol/L, 95% CI: -1.26, -0.26, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) vs. C. Serum insulin also showed group-by-time interactions at 16\u00a0weeks whereby fold changes were lower in EP (mean difference: -0.40, 95% CI: -0.65, -0.16, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and P (mean difference: -0.32, 95% CI: -0.56, -0.08, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009) vs. C, and fold changes in HOMA-IR improved in EP (mean difference: -0.37, 95% CI: -0.64, -0.10, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and P (mean difference: -0.27, 95% CI: -0.53, -0.00, P\u00a0=\u00a00.048) vs. C. Serum resistin declined in P only (group-by-time interaction at 16\u00a0weeks: P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). No other interactions were observed in outcome measures (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), and kidney function (eGFR) remained unaltered.

Quality assessment was done using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and a random-effects model was employed for the meta-analysis. The review included 17 studies with 317 participants (21% female). The results revealed a significant effect size of 0.47 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.89) for maximal strength (1RM, 3RM, maximal isokinetic or isometric force), particularly in the lower body (SMD: 0.49, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.98). No significant effects were found for upper body strength, cycling sprint power, bench press throws power, or muscular endurance. However, vertical jumping performance improved significantly (SMD: 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.69) after excluding a low-quality study. In conclusion, betaine supplementation for at least 7\u2009days significantly enhances muscular strength, especially lower body strength, and shows potential in improving vertical jumping performance.",

          "content": "Various nutritional strategies are adopted for athletes to maintain and to improve performance during the competition season. Betaine may enhance performance during a competitive season by increasing the testosterone to cortisol ratio and reducing systemic inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of betaine supplementation on the bio-motor abilities in young professional soccer players. Twenty-nine young professional soccer players (age, 15.5\u00b10.3 years) were matched by position and randomly assigned to one of two groups for 14 weeks: betaine (BG, 2\u00a0g/day; n=14) or placebo (PG n=15). Diet was standardized by a nutritionist, and measures of muscular power (countermovement jump: CMJ), change of direction: modified 5-0-5), acceleration (10\u00a0m sprint), sprint performance (30\u00a0m sprint time: SpT), muscular strength (leg press and bench press one repetition maximum: 1-RM), repeated sprint ability (running-based anaerobic sprint test: RAST), and aerobic capacity (30-15 intermittent fitness test) were assessed in the pre (P1), mid (P2) and post (P3) season over the course of 5 days. All subjects participated in one soccer match and five training sessions per week. Significant (p < 0.05) group x time interactions were found for maximal oxygen uptake (VO), anaerobic peak power, and muscular strength favoring BG at P2 and P3 compared to P1. There were meaningful (p < 0.05) group x time interactions for CMJ, SpT, and peak power during the RAST that favored the BG. 14-week of betaine supplementation increased predicted 1-RM, VO, and repeated sprint ability performance in youth professional soccer players. Betaine supplementation seems to be a useful nutritional strategy to improve and to maintain performance during a competitive soccer season.",

The effects of chronic betaine supplementation on exercise performance, skeletal muscle oxygen saturation, and associated biochemical parameters in resistance trained men. J Strength Cond Res 25(12): 3461-3471, 2011-We examined the effects of chronic betaine supplementation on exercise performance and associated parameters in resistance trained men. Men were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner using a crossover design to consume betaine (2.5 g of betaine mixed in 500 ml of Gatorade\u00ae) or a placebo (500 ml of Gatorade\u00ae) for 14 days, with a 21-day washout period. Before and after each treatment period, tests of lower- and upper-body muscular power and isometric force were conducted, including a test of upper-body muscular endurance (10 sets of bench press exercise to failure). Muscle tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) during the bench press protocol was measured via near infrared spectroscopy. Blood samples were collected before and after the exercise test protocol for analysis of lactate, nitrate/nitrite (NOx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). When analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance, no significant differences were noted between conditions for exercise performance variables (p > 0.05). However, an increase in total repetitions (p = 0.01) and total volume load (p = 0.02) in the 10-set bench press protocol was noted with betaine supplementation (paired t-tests), with values increasing approximately 6.5% from preintervention to postintervention. Although not of statistical significance (p = 0.14), postexercise blood lactate increased to a lesser extent with betaine supplementation (210%) compared with placebo administration (270%). NOx was lower postintervention as compared with preintervention (p = 0.06), and MDA was relatively unchanged. The decrease in StO2 during the bench press protocol was greater with betaine vs. placebo (p = 0.01), possibly suggesting enhanced muscle oxygen consumption. These findings indicate that betaine supplementation results in a moderate increase in total repetitions and volume load in the bench press exercise, without favorably impacting other performance measures.",

          "content": "Betaine exhibits significant physiological functions in organisms and has positive impacts on obesity, alcohol-induced and metabolic-associated liver disease, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. However, the evidence from epidemiological studies is limited and inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary betaine intake and the incidence of overweight or obesity. A total of 492 subjects from a dietary survey were equally classified into four groups (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) according to the quartiles of dietary betaine intake and further investigate the correlation of betaine intake with body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (Homa-IR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The study subjects were further divided into normal-weight and overweight/obesity groups to compare the differences in obesity-related indices and betaine intake between the normal-weight and overweight/obesity individuals. The association between dietary betaine intake and the presence of overweight/obesity was performed by logistic regression. The results indicated that a higher betaine intake was correlated with a lower BMI and HC. And higher intake of calorie and macronutrients, as well as food species like cereals, meats, tubers, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, were also associated with an increased betaine intake. Cereals, being a main food source of betaine, provided more than 85% of betaine in the daily diet. Furthermore, subjects with normal weight had a higher dietary betaine intake than those with overweight/obesity. Logistic regression showed that the highest quartile (Q4) of betaine intake was associated with a lower incidence of overweight/obesity risk. In conclusion, cereals were the main food source of dietary betaine intake. There was a significant difference in dietary betaine intake between normal weight and overweight/obese individuals. Importantly, the highest betaine intake was associated with a lower risk of overweight/obesity.",

Using a double-blind, crossover study design, 10 handball players (age \u00b1 SD\u00a0=\u00a016\u00a0\u00b1 1\u00a0yrs) without prior-structured RE experience performed a high-intensity RE session (leg press followed by bench press; 5 sets to volitional fatigue using 80% baseline 1 repetition maximum (1RM)), before and after 14\u00a0days of either placebo (maltodextrin) or betaine (2.5\u00a0g\u00b7d) supplementation. A 30-day washout period separated each treatment. 48\u00a0h prior to testing sessions, participants recorded their food intake and did not perform strenuous exercise. Venous blood was sampled before supplementation, and before and after each RE session. After betaine supplementation, participants performed more repetitions ( < 0.001) during the leg press (Betaine: 35.8\u00a0\u00b1 4.3; Placebo: 24.8\u00a0\u00b1 3.6, Cohen's  =\u00a02.77) and bench press (Betaine: 36.3\u00a0\u00b1 2.6; Placebo: 26.1\u00a0\u00b1 3.5, Cohen's  =\u00a03.34).

Three 10\u2009s sprint tests were then completed against a resistance of 7.5% of body mass, separated by 2.5\u2009min of recovery. The study comprised 3 phases: (a) pre-supplementation, (b) randomization to supplement for 2-weeks with either 2.4\u2009g/day BET or placebo (parallel design), and (c) post-supplementation. Repeated-measures analysis of variance were conducted to determine interactions or main effects. There were no group differences for substrate oxidation rates (\u2009>\u20090.05). Although body composition improved pre-post for both groups (\u2009<\u20090.05), only the BET group experienced a significant increase in fat free mass (\u2009<\u20090.01; \u223c3%). Further, only the BET group experienced improvements to performance such as a higher mean power output during the final sprint (\u2009=\u20090.02; \u223c3%) and a lower RPE during the final stage of the graded exercise test (\u2009=\u20090.02).

Based on the available evidence, we hypothesized that dietary choline and betaine do not increase mortality risk. This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association of dietary choline and betaine with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke. Online databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched up to 9 March 2024. Six cohort studies comprising 482,778 total participants, 57,235 all-cause, 9351 cardiovascular disease, and 4,400 stroke deaths were included in this study. The linear dose-response analysis showed that each 100 mg/day increase in choline intake was significantly associated with 6% and 11% increases in risk of all-cause (RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.10, I =83.7%, P < .001) and cardiovascular diseases mortality (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.16, I = 54.3%, P = .02) respectively. However, dietary betaine, was not associated with the risk of mortality. Furthermore, the result of the nonlinear dose-response analysis showed a significant relationship between betaine intake and stroke mortality at the dosages of 50 to 250 mg/day (P= .0017). This study showed that each 100 mg/day increment in choline consumption was significantly associated with a 6% and 11% higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality respectively. In addition, a significant positive relationship between betaine intake and stroke mortality at doses of 50 to 250 mg/day was observed.

          "content": "Choline is an important metabolite involved in phospholipids synthesis, including serum lipids, and is the immediate precursor of betaine. There are numerous studies with inconsistent results that evaluated the association between dietary choline intakes with cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between dietary betaine and choline intakes with cardio-metabolic risk factors is not well studied. In the current study, our aim was to evaluate dietary choline and betaine intakes in the usual diet of obese individuals and to assess its association with serum lipids, blood pressure and glycemic markers among obese individuals. We recruited a total number of 359 obese people aged between 20 and 50 years in the present study. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used for dietary assessment; dietary choline and betaine intakes were calculated using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) database. National cholesterol education program adult treatment panel (NCEP-ATP)-III criteria was used metabolic syndrome (MetS) definition. Enzymatic methods were used to assess biochemical variables. Body composition was measured with the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method. Higher body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), fat-free mass (FFM) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were observed in higher tertiles of dietary choline intake (P\u2009<\u20090.01). There was no significant difference in terms of biochemical parameters among different tertiles of dietary choline intake, while systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were reduced in higher betaine tertiles (P\u2009<\u20090.05). For total dietary choline and betaine intakes, there was a reduction in DBP and low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Also, a non-significant reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and MetS prevalence was observed in higher tertiles of dietary choline and betaine intakes. After classification of the study population according to MetS status, there was no significant difference in biochemical variables in subjects with MetS (P\u2009>\u20090.05), while in the non-MetS group, SBP, DBP, TG and insulin levels reduced in higher tertiles of dietary betaine and choline (P\u2009>\u20090.05). According to our findings, higher dietary intakes of choline and betaine were associated with lower levels of blood pressure and LDL concentrations among obese individuals. Further studies are warranted to confirm the results of the current study.",

          "content": "A high homocysteine concentration is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease that can be reduced through betaine supplementation. Choline is the precursor for betaine, but the effects of choline supplementation on plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations in healthy humans are unknown. The objective was to investigate whether supplementation with phosphatidylcholine, the form in which choline occurs in foods, reduces fasting and postmethionine-loading concentrations of plasma tHcy in healthy men with mildly elevated plasma tHcy concentrations. In a crossover study, 26 men ingested approximately 2.6 g choline/d (as phosphatidylcholine) or a placebo oil mixture for 2 wk in random order. Fatty acid composition and fat content were similar for both treatments. A methionine-loading test was performed on the first and last days of each supplementation period. Phosphatidylcholine supplementation for 2 wk decreased mean fasting plasma tHcy by 18% (-3.0 micromol/L; 95% CI: -3.9, -2.1 micromol/L). On the first day of supplementation, a single dose of phosphatidylcholine containing 1.5 g choline reduced the postmethionine-loading increase in tHcy by 15% (-4.8 micromol/L; 95% CI: -6.8, -2.8 micromol/L). Phosphatidylcholine supplementation for 2 wk reduced the postmethionine-loading increase in tHcy by 29% (-9.2 micromol/L; 95% CI: -11.3, -7.2 micromol/L). All changes were relative to placebo. A high daily dose of choline, supplemented as phosphatidylcholine, lowers fasting as well as postmethionine-loading plasma tHcy concentrations in healthy men with mildly elevated tHcy concentrations. If high homocysteine concentrations indeed cause cardiovascular disease, choline intake may reduce cardiovascular disease risk in humans.",

          "content": "Controversy regarding the effects of betaine supplementation on cardiovascular markers has persisted for decades. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of betaine supplementation on cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers. Studies examining betaine supplementation on CVD markers published up to February 2021 were identified through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and SCOPUS. Betaine supplementation had a significant effect on concentrations of betaine (MD: 82.14\u2009\u03bcmol/L, 95% CI: 67.09 to 97.20), total cholesterol (TC) (MD: 14.12\u2009mg/dl, 95% CI%: 9.23 to 19.02), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (MD: 10.26\u2009mg/dl, 95% CI: 6.14 to 14.38)], homocysteine (WMD: -1.30 micromol/L, 95% CI: -1.61 to -0.98), dimethylglycine (DMG) (MD: 21.33 micromol/L, 95% CI: 13.87 to 28.80), and methionine (MD: 2.06 micromol/L, 95% CI: 0.23 to 3.88). Moreover, our analysis indicated that betaine supplementation did not affect serum concentrations of triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood glucose (FBG), C-reactive protein (CRP), liver enzymes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)], and blood pressure. Our subgroup analysis suggested that a maximum dose of 4\u2009g/d might have homocysteine-lowering effects without any adverse effect on lipid profiles reported with doses of \u22654\u2009g/d. In conclusion, the present systematic review and meta-analysis supports the advantage of a lower dose of betaine supplementation (<4\u2009g/d) on homocysteine concentrations without the lipid-augmenting effect observed with a higher dosage.",

          "content": "Choline and betaine have been suggested to play a pivotal role in neurotransmitter synthesis, cell membrane integrity, and methyl-group metabolism, exerting neuroprotective effects in patients with various neurological disorders. However, population-based evidence on choline and betaine with subsequent cardiovascular events after stroke is rare. We aimed to prospectively investigate the relationships of circulating choline and betaine with cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic stroke. We performed a nested case-control study within the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke. A total of 323 cardiovascular events (including 264 recurrent strokes) and 323 controls (free of recurrent cardiovascular events) matched for age (\u00b11 y), sex, and treatment group were included. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events after ischemic stroke. Plasma choline and betaine were measured at baseline by ultra-high-performance LC-MS/MS. Conditional logistic regression models were applied, and discrimination, reclassification, and calibration of models with choline pathway metabolites were evaluated. Plasma choline and betaine were inversely associated with cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke after ischemic stroke. Specifically, in fully adjusted models, each additional SD of choline and betaine was associated with 35% (95% CI: 20%-48%) and 30% (95% CI: 14%-43%) decreased risks of subsequent cardiovascular events, respectively, and 34% (95% CI: 16%-48%) and 29% (95% CI: 12%-43%) decreased risks of recurrent stroke, respectively. In addition, both choline and betaine offered substantial risk discrimination and reclassification improvement for cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke beyond traditional risk factors, as evidenced by an increase in C statistics, the net reclassification index, and integrated discrimination improvement. Plasma choline pathway metabolites, including choline and betaine, were associated with decreased risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke and provided incremental value in risk discrimination and stratification in patients with ischemic stroke. This nested case-control study was based on the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke, which is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01840072.",

          "content": "Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a microbiome-derived metabolite from the metabolism of choline, betaine, and carnitines, is associated to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. A method suitable for routine quantification of TMAO and its precursors (trimethylamine (TMA), choline, betaine, creatinine, and propionyl-, acetyl-, and L-carnitine) in clinical and food samples has been developed based on LC-MS. TMA was successfully derivatized using iodoacetonitrile, and no cross-reactions with TMAO or the other methylamines were detected. Extraction from clinical samples (plasma and urine) was performed after protein precipitation using acetonitrile:methanol. For food samples (meatballs and eggs), water extraction was shown to be sufficient, but acid hydrolysis was required to release bound choline before extraction. Baseline separation of the methylamines was achieved using a neutral HILIC column and a mobile phase consisting of 25 mmol/L ammonium formate in water:ACN (30:70). Quantification was performed by MS using external calibration and isotopic labelled internal standards. The assay proved suitable for both clinical and food samples and was linear from \u2248 0.1 up to 200 \u03bcmol/L for all methylamines except for TMA and TMAO, which were linear up to 100 \u03bcmol/L. Recoveries were 91-107% in clinical samples and 76-98% in food samples. The interday (n=8, four duplicate analysis) CVs were below 9% for all metabolites in clinical and food samples. The method was applied successfully to determine the methylamine concentrations in plasma and urine from the subjects participating in an intervention trial (n=10) to determine the effect of animal food ingestion on methylamine concentrations.",

          "content": "L. contains compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but its effects on exercise-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses are unclear. The aim of this study was to examine whether  L. supplementation can attenuate oxidative stress and inflammatory responses to acute aerobic exercise and improve DOMS. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design study, thirteen healthy men received either a daily supplement of  L. or a placebo for 4\u2009weeks (2-week wash-out period between trials). Before and after the supplementation periods, participants performed an exercise test to exhaustion (75% VOmax). DOMS, thigh girth, and knee joint range of motion (KJRM) were assessed before and after the exercise (2, 24, and 48\u2009h). Blood samples were analyzed for reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, GSH/GSSG ratio, protein carbonyls, total antioxidant capacity, creatine kinase activity, white blood cell count, and TBARS. Acute exercise to exhaustion induced inflammatory responses and changed the blood redox status in both Tribulus and Placebo groups (\u2009<\u20090.050).  L. improved GSH fall (\u2009=\u20090.005), GSSG rise (\u2009=\u20090.001) and maintained a higher level of GSH/GSSG ratio at the 2\u2009h point (\u2009=\u20090.034). TBARS were lowered, protein carbonyls, creatine kinase activity, and white blood cell count elevation diminished significantly (\u2009<\u20090.050).  L. administration did not affect DOMS, thigh girth, or KJRM (\u2009>\u20090.050). 4-weeks of  L. supplementation effectively attenuates oxidative stress responses but cannot improve DOMS.",

Herein we present a case with acute massive pulmonary embolism while using an herbal combination in the context of Tribulus terrestris, Avena sativa and Panax ginseng. A 41-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with the complaint of sudden onset of dyspnea and syncope. As a result of investigations (blood gases, echocardiography, ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy) he was diagnosed with an acute massive pulmonary embolism. The patient's use of panax did not pose as a risk factor for the pulmonary embolism. He was given thrombolytic therapy and shortness of breath improved. At the pre-discharge the patient was informed of the risks associated with the herbal combination, especially panax. Coumadin was started and he was discharged for the INR checks to come.",

          "title": "The Additive Effects of Creatine Supplementation and Exercise Training in an Aging Population: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.",
          "content": "The role of creatine supplementation in young athletes and bodybuilders is well established including ergogenic properties of muscular hypertrophy, strength, power, and endurance. Whether the benefits of creatine supplementation translate to an aging population with moderate training stimulus remains unclear especially in regard to gender, creatine dose, and duration. This systematic review assessed whether creatine supplementation combined with exercise results in additive improvements in indices of skeletal muscle, bone, and mental health over exercise alone in healthy older adults. PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were utilized to identify randomized controlled trials of creatine supplementation combined with exercise in an aging population with additional predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, and performed quality assessments using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Seventeen studies were comprehensively reviewed according to categories of strength, endurance, functional capacity, body composition, cognition, and safety. These studies suggest that any additive ergogenic creatine effects on upper and/or lower body strength, functional capacity, and lean mass in an older population would require a continuous and daily low-dose creatine supplementation combined with at least 12 weeks of resistance training. Potential creatine specific increases in regional bone mineral density of the femur are possible but may require at least 1 year of creatine supplementation combined with moderate resistance training, and additional long-term clinical trials are warranted. The limited data suggested no additive effects of creatine over exercise alone on indices of mental health. The beneficial effects of creatine supplementation are more consistent in older women than in men. Creatine monohydrate is safe to use in older adults. While creatine in conjunction with moderate- to high-intensity exercise in an aging population may improve skeletal muscle health, additional studies are needed to determine the effective dosing and duration paradigm for potential combined creatine and exercise effects on bone and cognition in older adults.",

Eligible studies included adult participants receiving creatine and \u03b2-alanine together compared to creatine or \u03b2-alanine alone for at least four weeks and assessed measures of exercise performance and/or body composition.

Efficacy of alternative forms of creatine supplementation on improving performance and body composition in healthy subjects: a systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 36(9): 2663-2670, 2022-Novel forms of creatine have appeared in the marketplace with substantial claims of improved efficacy compared to creatine monohydrate (CrM). The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review on alternative forms of creatine to determine (a) whether they are effective ergogenic aids and (b) whether they outperform CrM. A separate comparison was conducted to determine average cost of various forms of creatine. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar were systematically reviewed according to PRISMA guidelines. The design of the review was set to answer the PICOS model (subjects, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design). Seventeen randomized placebo controlled clinical trials examining exercise performance outcomes and body composition were included in the analysis. Magnesium-creatine chelate and creatine citrate, malate, ethyl ester, nitrate, and pyruvate were the only forms researched in the literature. Of these studies, only 3 studies compared the alternative creatine form to CrM, making it difficult to compare efficacy to CrM. There were no consistent findings of performance enhancement among alternative forms of creatine when compared to placebo. A review of the marketplace shows that CrM is the lowest cost form of creatine. Due to the paucity of studies on alternative forms of creatine as well as high prices on the market of these alternative forms, CrM remains as the most extensively studied form of creatine that shows efficacy, safety, and lowest cost to consumer.",

          "content": "The efficacy of creatine replacement through supplementation for the optimization of physical function in the population at risk of functional disability is unclear. We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from inception to November 2022. Studies included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing creatine supplementation with placebos in older adults and adults with chronic disease. The primary outcome was physical function measured by the sit-to-stand test after pooling data using random-effects modeling. We also performed a Bayesian meta-analysis to describe the treatment effect in probability terms. Secondary outcomes included other measures of physical function, muscle function, and body composition. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We identified 33 RCTs, comprising 1076 participants. From six trials reporting the primary outcome, the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-1.00; I\u2009=\u200962%; P\u2009=\u20090.04); using weakly informative priors, the posterior probability that creatine supplementation improves physical function was 66.7%. Upper-body muscle strength (SMD: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.06-0.44; I\u2009=\u20090%; P\u2009=\u20090.01), handgrip strength (SMD 0.23; 95% CI: 0.01-0.45; I\u2009=\u20090%; P\u2009=\u20090.04), and lean tissue mass (MD 1.08\u2009kg; 95% CI: 0.77-1.38; I\u2009=\u200926%; P\u2009<\u20090.01) improved with creatine supplementation. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was low or very low because of a high risk of bias. Creatine supplementation improves sit-to-stand performance, muscle function, and lean tissue mass. It is crucial to conduct high-quality prospective RCTs to confirm these hypotheses (PROSPERO number, CRD42023354929).",

          "content": "This study aimed to compare the effects of an 8-week creatine (CR) or placebo (PL) supplementation on muscle strength, thickness, endurance, and body composition employing different training paradigms with blood flow restriction (BFR) vs. traditional resistance training (TRAD). Seventeen healthy males were randomized between the PL (\u00a0=\u00a09) and CR (\u00a0=\u00a08) groups. Participants were trained unilaterally utilizing a within-between subject bicep curl exercise where each arm was allocated to TRAD or BFR for 8 weeks. Muscular strength, thickness, endurance, and body composition were evaluated. Creatine supplementation promoted increases in muscle thickness in TRAD and BFR compared with their placebo counterparts, however, without a significant difference between treatments (\u00a0=\u00a00.349). TRAD training increased maximum strength (1 repetition maximum (1RM)) compared with BFR after 8 weeks of training (\u00a0=\u00a00.021). Repetitions to failure at 30% of 1RM were increased in the BFR-CR group compared with the TRAD-CR group (\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Repetitions to failure at 70% 1RM were increased from weeks 0-4 (\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 4-8 (\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in all groups. Creatine supplementation exerted a hypertrophic effect when utilized with TRAD and BFR paradigms and increased muscle performance at 30% 1RM when utilized in conjunction with BFR. Therefore, creatine supplementation seems to amplify muscle adaptation following a BFR program.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of creatine supplementation on body composition were included. Electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched up to July 2023. Heterogeneity tests were performed. Random effect models were assessed based on the heterogeneity tests, and pooled data were examined to determine the weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). From 4831 initial records, a total of 143 studies met the inclusion criteria. Creatine supplementation increased body mass (WMD: 0.86\u2009kg; 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.96, I\u2009=\u20090%) and fat-free mass (WMD: 0.82\u2009kg; 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.06, I\u2009=\u20090%) while reducing body fat percentage (WMD: -0.28 %; 95% CI: -0.47 to -0.09; I\u2009=\u20090%). Studies that incorporated a maintenance dose of creatine or performed resistance training in conjunction with supplementation had greater effects on body composition.

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of creatine supplementation on the body composition and Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. An exploratory 1-year balanced, placebo-controlled, and double-blind design was conducted with hemodialysis patients (\u226518 years). The creatine group (CG) received 5 g of creatine monohydrate and 5 g of maltodextrin per day and the placebo group (PG) received 10 g of maltodextrin per day. MIS and body composition were analyzed at three time points: pre, intermediate (after 6 months), and post (after 12 months). After 6 months, 60% of patients on creatine experienced an increase in FFM compared to a 36.8% increase for those on placebo. Moreover, 65% of patients on creatine increased their skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) compared to only 15.8% for those on placebo. Creatine increased intracellular water (ICW) in 60% of patients. MIS did not change after the intervention. In the CG, there was an increase in body weight ( = 0.018), FFM ( = 0.010), SMMI ( = 0.022). CG also increased total body water (pre 35.4 L, post 36.1 L;  = 0.008), mainly due to ICW (pre 20.2 L, intermediate 20.7 L, post 21.0 L;  = 0.016). Long-term creatine supplementation in hemodialysis patients did not attenuate the MIS, but enhanced FFM and SMMI, which was likely triggered by an increase in ICW.",

J Strength Cond Res 38(10): 1813-1821, 2024-The purpose of this review was to determine the added effect of creatine supplementation on changes in body composition with resistance training in adults younger than 50 years. The review protocol was preregistered on the Open Science Framework (osf.io/x48a6/). Our primary outcome was lean body mass (LBM); secondary outcomes were body fat percentage (%) and body fat mass (kg). We performed a random-effects meta-analysis in R using the metafor package. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the effects of training status and use of a carbohydrate drink with creatine. We conducted a meta-regression to examine the moderating effect of total training volume. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. One thousand six hundred ninety-four records were screened, and 67 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis. Fifty-two percentages of the studies had low risk, 41% some concerns, and 7% high risk of bias. Compared with resistance training (RT) alone, creatine supplementation increased LBM by 1.14 kg (95% CI 0.69 to 1.59), and reduced body fat percentage by -0.88% (95% CI -1.66 to -0.11) and body fat mass by -0.73 kg (95% CI -1.34 to -0.11). There were no differences between training status or carbohydrate subgroups. Training volume was not associated with effect size in all outcomes; 7 g or 0.3 g/kg of body mass of creatine per day is likely to increase LBM by 1 kg and reduce fat mass by 0.7 kg more than RT alone.

Peak CK values during the experimental period correlated (P < 0.01) with workload/cross-sectional area of the QFM (r = 0.658), workload/volume of the QFM (r = 0.648), and knee extensor strength/body mass (r = -0.634); however, the HR and LR groups were separated in each variable. Thus the break point of CK release after endurance exercise under these conditions is 300-500 IU/l, two or three times higher than in the resting condition, and is associated with properties of the QFM.",

Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of creatine on muscle function and metabolism, aerobic capacity, fatigue, physical activity, and quality of life (QOL), as well as its safety. We conducted a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, multiple-baseline design; patients were assigned to creatine or placebo. Feasibility was assessed using attended study visits, completed study procedures, and adherence. Muscle function, aerobic capacity, and muscle strength were assessed with standardized exercise tests. Muscle metabolism was assessed using a 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy protocol. Fatigue, physical activity, and QOL were assessed by questionnaires. Statistical significance was estimated using a randomization (permutation) test. Changes in outcome measures taken at baseline and end-of-study were calculated using paired -tests. Median (range) adherence to the study drug was 88.5% (20.5-95.5%) and the proportion of subjects with 80% adherence or higher was 76.9%. There were no missed study visits. There were no statistically significant changes in muscle function, strength, aerobic capacity, disease activity, fatigue, physical activity, or QOL while subjects were receiving creatine compared to placebo. There were statistically significant adaptations in muscle metabolism (e.g., decrease in change in muscle pH following exercise, and decrease in phosphate/phosphocreatine ratio) at the end-of-study compared to baseline. There were no significant adverse effects. Creatine supplementation in children with JDM is feasible to study, and is safe and well-tolerated; it may lead to improvements in muscle metabolism.",

          "content": "Muscle mass is important for metastatic prostate cancer survival and quality of life (QoL). The backbone of treatment for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with an androgen signaling inhibitor. ADT is an effective cancer treatment, but it facilitates significant declines in muscle mass and adverse health outcomes important to mCSPC survivors, such as fatigue, and reductions in physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, and QoL. In non-metastatic CSPC survivors, resistance training (RT) preserves muscle mass and improves these related health outcomes, but the biggest barrier to RT in CSPC survivors of all stages is fatigue. Creatine monohydrate supplementation coupled with RT (Cr\u2009+\u2009RT) may address this barrier since creatine plays a critical role in energy metabolism. Cr\u2009+\u2009RT in cancer-free older adults and other clinical populations improves muscle mass and related health outcomes. Evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation can complement cancer treatment. Thus, Cr\u2009+\u2009RT is a strategy that addresses gaps in survivorship needs of people with mCSPC. The purpose of this parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial is to test the effects of 52-weeks of Cr\u2009+\u2009RT compared with placebo (PLA) and RT (PLA\u2009+\u2009RT) on muscle mass, other related health outcomes, and markers of cancer progression. We will carry out this trial with our team's established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program in 200 mCSPC survivors receiving ADT, and evaluate outcomes at baseline, 24-, and 52-weeks. RT will occur twice weekly with elastic resistance bands, and an established creatine supplementation protocol will be used for supplementation delivery. Our approach addresses a major facilitator to RT in mCSPC survivors, a home-based RT program, while utilizing a supervised model for safety. Findings will improve delivery of comprehensive survivorship care by providing a multicomponent, patient-centered lifestyle strategy to preserve muscle mass, improve health outcomes, and complement cancer treatment (NCT06112990).",

          "content": "Creatine supplementation has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological therapeutic strategy to counteract muscle dysfunction and low lean mass in a variety of conditions, including in pediatric and rheumatic diseases. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of creatine supplementation in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus (C-SLE). C-SLE patients with mild disease activity (n = 15) received placebo or creatine supplementation in a randomized fashion using a crossover, double-blind, repeated-measures design. The participants were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks in each arm, interspersed by an eight-week washout period. The primary outcomes were muscle function, as assessed by a battery of tests including one-maximum repetition (1-RM) tests, the timed-up-and-go test, the timed-stands test, and the handgrip test. Secondary outcomes included body composition, biochemical markers of bone remodeling, aerobic conditioning, quality of life, and physical capacity. Possible differences in dietary intake were assessed by three 24-hour dietary recalls. Muscle phosphorylcreatine content was measured through phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31 P-MRS). The safety of the intervention was assessed by laboratory parameters, and kidney function was measured by (51)Cr-EDTA clearance. Additionally, self-reported adverse events were recorded throughout the trial. Intramuscular phosphorylcreatine content was not significantly different between creatine and placebo before or after the intervention (creatine-Pre: 20.5 \u00b1 2.6, Post: 20.4 \u00b1 4.1, placebo-Pre: 19.8 \u00b1 2.0; Post: 20.2 \u00b1 3.2 mmol/kg wet muscle; p = 0.70 for interaction between conditions). In addition, probably as a consequence of the lack of change in intramuscular phosphorylcreatine content, there were no significant changes between placebo and creatine for any muscle function and aerobic conditioning parameters, lean mass, fat mass, bone mass, and quality of life scores (p > 0.05). The (51)Cr-EDTA clearance was not altered by creatine supplementation and no side effects were noticed. A 12-week creatine supplementation protocol at 0.1 g/kg/d is well tolerated and free of adverse effects but did not affect intramuscular phosphorylcreatine, muscle function, free-fat mass or quality of life in non-active C-SLE patients.

The participants were divided into two groups: a mixed protein group (MG, \u2009=\u200930), and a placebo control group (CG, \u2009=\u200930). They were instructed to ingest either a supplement containing casein calcium, whey protein, and isolated pea protein, or a placebo, once daily for 8\u2009weeks. Pre- and posttests consisted of anthropometric measurements, muscle strength (isokinetic knee and trunk strength, and handgrip strength), 2-minute push-ups, balance, and golf swing performance using a driver and 7-iron. After the 8-week supplementation period, ANCOVA, using baseline values as covariates, revealed significant differences for driver distance (\u2009=\u2009.004) and driver ball speed (\u2009<\u2009.001). MG significantly increased driver distance by 5.17\u2009\u00b1\u200912.8\u2009m (\u2009=\u2009.046), driver ball speed by 1.36\u2009\u00b1\u20092.87\u2009m/s (\u2009=\u2009.021). Additionally, significantly improvements were observed in hand grip strength (+2.12\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47\u2009kg, \u2009=\u2009.004), two-minute push-ups (+4.89\u2009\u00b1\u20098.14 reps, \u2009=\u2009.004), and balance score (-0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69\u2009min, \u2009=\u2009.009). No significant differences were observed in body composition parameters (\u2009>\u2009.05). The intake of a mixed protein containing both animal and plant proteins had positive effects on golf performance and muscle function. Therefore, mixed proteins may represent a safe and effective approach to enhancing skeletal muscle health in golf players.",

We aimed to elucidate how habituated amounts of protein intake affect the fasted state of, and the stimulatory effect of a protein-rich meal on, protein absorption, whole-body protein turnover, and splanchnic amino acid metabolism. Twelve men (65-70 y) were included in a double-blinded crossover intervention study, consisting of a 20-d habituation period to a protein intake at the RDA or a high amount [1.1 g \u00b7 kg lean body mass (LBM)-1 \u00b7 d-1 or >2.1 g \u00b7 kg LBM-1 \u00b7 d-1, respectively], each followed by an experimental trial with a primed, constant infusion of D8-phenylalanine and D2-tyrosine. Arterial and hepatic venous blood samples were obtained after an overnight fast and repeatedly 4 h after a standardized meal including intrinsically labeled whey protein concentrate and calcium-caseinate proteins. Blood was analyzed for amino acid concentrations and phenylalanine and tyrosine tracer enrichments from which whole-body and splanchnic amino acid and protein kinetics were calculated. High (compared with the recommended amount of) protein intake resulted in a higher fasting whole-body protein turnover with a resultant mean \u00b1 SEM 0.03 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg LBM-1 \u00b7 min-1 lower net balance (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which was not rescued by the intake of a protein-dense meal. The mean \u00b1 SEM plasma protein fractional synthesis rate was 0.13 \u00b1 0.06%/h lower (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after habituation to high protein. Furthermore, higher fasting and postprandial amino acid removal were observed after habituation to high protein, yielding higher urea excretion and increased phenylalanine oxidation rates (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Three weeks of habituation to high protein intake (>2.1 g protein \u00b7 kg LBM-1 \u00b7 d-1) led to a significantly higher net protein loss in the fasted state. This was not compensated for in the 4-h postprandial period after intake of a meal high in protein.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02587156.",

          "content": ": High-protein diets increase weight loss (WL) during energy restriction; therefore, it has been suggested that additional protein intake may improve weight maintenance (WM) after WL.

In a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial, 220 participants aged 18-60 y with body mass index (in kg/m) from 27.6 to 40.4 were included. The study was initiated with an 8-wk WL period followed by a 24-wk WM period. During WM, participants consumed the following isocaloric supplements (45-48 g/d): whey and calcium (whey+), whey, soy, or maltodextrin (control). Data were collected at baseline, before WM, and after WM (weeks 0, 8, and 32, respectively) and included body composition, blood biochemistry, and blood pressure. Meal tests were performed to investigate diet-induced-thermogenesis (DIT) and appetite sensation. Compliance was tested by 24-h urinary nitrogen excretion. A total of 151 participants completed the WM period. The control and 3 protein supplements did not result in different mean \u00b1 SD weight regains (whey+: 2.19 \u00b1 4.6 kg; whey: 2.01 \u00b1 4.6 kg; soy: 1.76 \u00b1 4.7 kg; and control: 2.23 \u00b1 3.8 kg;  = 0.96), fat mass regains (whey+: 0.46 \u00b1 4.5 kg; whey: 0.11 \u00b1 4.1 kg; soy: 0.15 \u00b1 4.1 kg; and control: 0.54 \u00b1 3.3 kg;  = 0.96), or improvements in lean body mass (whey+: 1.87 \u00b1 1.7 kg; whey: 1.94 \u00b1 1.3 kg; soy: 1.58 \u00b1 1.4 kg; and control: 1.74 \u00b1 1.4 kg;  = 0.50) during WM.

Twenty-four professional U23 cyclists (19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years, peak oxygen uptake: 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9\u00a0ml/kg/min) participated in a six-day training camp.

Indicators of fatigue/recovery (Hooper index, Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes, countermovement jump), body composition, and performance (1-, 5-, and 20-minute time trials, as well as the estimated critical power) were assessed as study outcomes.

To investigate the effect of protein supplementation alone or combined with light-intensity or heavy-load resistance exercise on muscle size, strength, and function in older adults. In a 1-y randomized controlled trial, 208 healthy older adults (>65 y) were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 interventions: 1) carbohydrate supplementation (CARB); 2) collagen protein supplementation (COLL); 3) whey protein supplementation (WHEY); 4) light-intensity resistance training 3-5 times/wk with whey protein supplementation (LITW); and 5) heavy resistance training 3 times weekly with whey protein supplementation (HRTW). Protein supplements contained 20 g protein\u00a0+\u00a010 g carbohydrate, whereas CARB contained 30 g of carbohydrates. All intervention groups received the supplement twice daily. The primary outcome was change in the quadriceps cross-sectional area (qCSA). Secondary outcomes included measures of lower extremity strength and power, functional capabilities, and body composition. There were 184 participants who completed the study. COLL and WHEY did not affect any measured parameter compared to CARB. Compared to WHEY, HRTW improved the qCSA size (between-group difference, +1.68 cm2; 95% CI, +0.41 to +2.95 cm2; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), as well as dynamic (+18.4 Nm; 95% CI, +10.1 to +26.6 Nm; P\u00a0<\u00a010-4) and isometric knee extensor strength (+23.9 Nm; 95% CI, +14.2 to +33.6 Nm; P\u00a0<\u00a010-5). LITW did not improve the qCSA size, but increased dynamic knee extensor strength compared to WHEY (+13.7 Nm; 95% CI, +5.3 and +22.1 Nm; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Recommending protein supplementation as a stand-alone intervention for healthy older individuals seems ineffective in improving muscle mass and strength. Only HRTW was effective in both preserving muscle mass and increasing strength.

          "title": "Effect of dietary protein on bone loss in elderly men and women: the Framingham Osteoporosis Study.",
          "content": "Few studies have evaluated protein intake and bone loss in elders. Excess protein may be associated with negative calcium balance, whereas low protein intake has been associated with fracture. We examined the relation between baseline dietary protein and subsequent 4-year change in bone mineral density (BMD) for 391 women and 224 men from the population-based Framingham Osteoporosis Study. BMD (g/cm2) was assessed in 1988-1989 and in 1992-1993 at the femur, spine, and radius. Usual dietary protein intake was determined using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and expressed as percent of energy from protein intake. BMD loss over 4 years was regressed on percent protein intake, simultaneously adjusting for other baseline factors: age, weight, height, weight change, total energy intake, smoking, alcohol intake, caffeine, physical activity, calcium intake, and, for women, current estrogen use. Effects of animal protein on bone loss also were examined. Mean age at baseline (+/-SD) of 615 participants was 75 years (+/-4.4; range, 68-91 years). Mean protein intake was 68 g/day (+/-24.0; range, 14-175 g/day), and mean percent of energy from protein was 16% (+/-3.4; range, 7-30%). Proportional protein intakes were similar for men and women. Lower protein intake was significantly related to bone loss at femoral and spine sites (p < or = 0.04) with effects similar to 10 lb of weight. Persons in the lowest quartile of protein intake showed the greatest bone loss. Similar to the overall protein effect, lower percent animal protein also was significantly related to bone loss at femoral and spine BMD sites (all p < 0.01) but not the radial shaft (p = 0.23). Even after controlling for known confounders including weight loss, women and men with relatively lower protein intake had increased bone loss, suggesting that protein intake is important in maintaining bone or minimizing bone loss in elderly persons. Further, higher intake of animal protein does not appear to affect the skeleton adversely in this elderly population.",

To determine the impact of protein supplementation during chronic endurance training on aerobic capacity, body composition and exercise performance in healthy and clinical populations. A systematic database search was conducted for randomised controlled trials addressing the effects of protein supplementation during endurance training on aerobic capacity, body composition and exercise performance in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Meta-analyses were performed to outline the overall effects of protein supplementation with all studies containing endurance training components. The effects of endurance training and add-on effects of protein supplementation were evaluated by the meta-analyses with endurance training-focused studies. Nineteen studies and 1162 participants contributed to the analyses. Compared with the control group, the protein supplementation group demonstrated greater improvements in aerobic capacity measured by mixed peak oxygen uptake (V\u0307O) and peak workload power (W) (standardised mean difference [SMD]\u00a0=\u00a00.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05 to 0.67), and V\u0307O (mean difference [MD]\u00a0=\u00a00.89\u00a0mL\u2027kg\u2027min, 95% CI: 0.07 to 1.70); had a greater lean mass gain (MD\u00a0=\u00a00.32\u00a0kg, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.58); and had a greater improvement in time trial performance (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-29.1s, 95% CI:-55.3 to\u00a0-3.0). Secondary analyses showed that, in addition to the substantial improvement in V\u0307O (MD\u00a0=\u00a03.67\u00a0mL\u2027kg\u2027min, 95% CI: 2.32 to 5.03) attributed to endurance training, protein supplementation provided an additional 26.4% gain in V\u0307O (MD\u00a0=\u00a00.97\u00a0mL\u2027kg\u2027min, 95% CI:\u00a0-0.03 to\u00a01.97).

Healthy male US Marine recruits from six platoons (US Marine Corps Base, Parris Island, SC; n = 387; 18.9 +/- 0.1 yr, 74.7 +/- 1.1 kg, 13.8 +/- 0.4% body fat) were randomly assigned to three treatments within each platoon. Nutrients supplemented immediately postexercise during the 54-day basic training were either placebo (0 g carbohydrate, 0 g protein, 0 g fat), control (8, 0, 3), or protein supplement (8, 10, 3). Subjects and observers making measurements and data analysis were blinded to subject groupings. Compared with placebo and control groups, the protein-supplemented group had an average of 33% fewer total medical visits, 28% fewer visits due to bacterial/viral infections, 37% fewer visits due to muscle/joint problems, and 83% fewer visits due to heat exhaustion. Recruits experiencing heat exhaustion had greater body mass, lean, fat, and water losses. Muscle soreness immediately postexercise was reduced by protein supplementation vs. placebo and control groups on both days 34 and 54. Postexercise protein supplementation may not only enhance muscle protein deposition but it also has significant potential to positively impact health, muscle soreness, and tissue hydration during prolonged intense exercise training, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention of health problems in severely stressed exercising populations.",

Nine sedentary, obese [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 34.0 +/- 1.0] men who had refrained from exercise and caffeine ingestion for 48 h underwent 2 oral-glucose-tolerance tests (OGTTs). The subjects randomly received caffeine (5 mg/kg) or placebo 1 h before each OGTT. After a 12-wk nutrition and exercise intervention, during which time the subjects avoided dietary caffeine, the OGTTs were repeated. The intervention resulted in decreases (P < or = 0.05) in body weight (8.5 +/- 1.5 kg), percentage body fat (2.8 +/- 0.7%), and fasting glucose, insulin, and proinsulin concentrations and increases in the ISI for the placebo OGTT (P < or = 0.05). Caffeine caused a greater (P < or = 0.05) OGTT insulin response and a lower (P < or = 0.05) ISI both before and after weight loss. The proinsulin-insulin ratio indicated that neither weight loss nor caffeine affected the nature of the beta cell secretion of insulin. A nutrition and exercise intervention improved, whereas caffeine ingestion impaired, insulin-glucose homeostasis in obese men. The results are consistent with previous findings that caffeine ingestion contributes to insulin resistance.",

The article \"Association Between Caffeine Intake and Fat-Free Mass Index: A Retrospective Cohort Study\" by Tian et al. explored this relationship, highlighting a positive correlation between caffeine consumption and fat-free mass index (FFMI). In this letter to the editor, we discuss the broader implications of these findings, emphasizing the need for further exploration of the underlying biological and lifestyle factors influencing caffeine's effects. To provide critical insights into the mechanisms and contextual factors that may explain the observed association between caffeine intake and FFMI, with particular focus on sex-specific differences, hormonal influences, and lifestyle interactions. This letter to editor builds on the findings of Tian et al., drawing from related literature and prior research to contextualize the potential mechanisms and broader implications of caffeine's impact on body composition. The discussion highlights key areas requiring further investigation, including the role of hormonal modulation, genetic variability, and long-term effects on muscle health. The positive association between caffeine intake and FFMI, particularly among women and younger populations, underscores the ergogenic potential of caffeine in enhancing muscle performance and metabolic efficiency. This letter expands on the study by emphasizing the role of hormonal factors, such as estrogen's modulation of CYP1A2, the liver enzyme critical for caffeine metabolism. The discussion also highlights the complex interplay between caffeine and other lifestyle factors. Finally, this commentary calls attention to the need for more research into the differential effects of caffeine sources, such as energy drinks and supplements, which often include additional ingredients with distinct metabolic and cardiovascular effects. These alternative sources may influence body composition differently than traditional coffee-based caffeine intake, an area that remains underexplored.",

          "content": "Caffeine is the most widely used drug in the world, commonly ingested in coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. Its ability to enhance muscular work has been apparent since the early 1900s. Caffeine typically increases endurance performance; however, efficacy of caffeine ingestion for short-term high-intensity exercise is equivocal, which may be explained by discrepancies in exercise protocols, dosing, and subjects' training status and habitual caffeine intake found across studies. The primary aim of this review is to critically examine studies that have tested caffeine's ability to augment performance during exercise dependent on nonoxidative metabolism such as sprinting, team sports, and resistance training. A review of the literature revealed 29 studies that measured alterations in short-term performance after caffeine ingestion. Each study was critically analyzed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The mean PEDro score was 7.76 +/- 0.87. Eleven of 17 studies revealed significant improvements in team sports exercise and power-based sports with caffeine ingestion, yet these effects were more common in elite athletes who do not regularly ingest caffeine. Six of 11 studies revealed significant benefits of caffeine for resistance training. Some studies show decreased performance with caffeine ingestion when repeated bouts are completed. The exact mechanism explaining the ergogenic effect of caffeine for short-term exercise is unknown.",

In the following visits, they performed 2 randomized time to exhaustion tests (15.4 \u00b1 0.7 km\u00b7h-1) after the ingestion of 300 mg of caffeine in a double-blind, crossover, randomized design. Maximal voluntary contraction of the knee extensor associated to surface electromyographic recording and the twitch interpolation technique were assessed before and immediately after the tests to quantify neuromuscular fatigue of the knee extensor muscles. Caffeine significantly improved exercise tolerance by 18% (p < 0.01). Neuromuscular responses decreased similarly after time to exhaustion in both exercise conditions; however, athletes were able to run a longer distance in the caffeine condition. The performance improvement induced by caffeine seems to have a neuromuscular contribution because athletes were able to run a longer distance with the same neuromuscular impairment.",

Over a 14-year period an hepatic function test, using caffeine as probe drug, has been systematically associated to the usual clinical and biochemical investigations performed in patients with liver alcoholic cirrhosis. \"Caffeine test\" consisted in a 200 mg caffeine oral intake. Urines were collected over 24 hours: caffeine (137X), 1-7 dimethylxanthine (17X), 1-3 dimethylxanthine (13X), 1-3 dimethylurate (13U), 3-7 dimethylxanthine (37X), 1-7 dimethylurate (17U), 1-methylxanthine (1X), 1-methylurate (1U), 7-methylxanthine (7X), 3-methylxanthine (3X), and 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracyl (AFMU) were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Total and individual metabolite urinary elimination rates were expressed in micromol/24 hours. Enzyme activities were evaluated from the following urinary metabolites ratios: (AFMU+1U+1X)/17U for CYPIA2, 17U/17X for CYP2A6, AFMU/(AFMU+ 1U+1X) for NAT-2, 1U/1X for XO. Compared to healthy subjects, whatever the Child score, caffeine metabolism was reduced by half in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The main cause was the decreased CYP1A2 activity. On the other hand, XO and CYP2A6 activities were increased and NAT-2 activity remained unchanged in slow acetylators (SA) and decreased in rapid acetylators (RA) Child B and C. Bimodality of NAT-2 distribution was unclear, but a right assignment of RA and SA phenotype in cirrhotic patients, confirmed by comparison with genotype, was obtained, using the antimode value of NAT-2 distribution used in healthy subjects. At last, there was an interindividual variability in caffeine metabolism as great as in the usual laboratory parameters. Metabolism of caffeine is decreased in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. This decrease paralleled the modifications of the usual laboratory tests and does not bring additional information on the severity of the disease. But the equilibrium between the various metabolic pathways of caffeine is impaired. Beyond the changes of a specific enzymatic activity, this must be taken into account particularly for drugs whose metabolism is of the polygenic regulation type.",

          "content": "The widely observed between-subject variability in cognitive responses to coffee may have a genetic basis. We evaluated cognitive responses to caffeine throughout three complex cognitive tasks assessing different subdomains of attention, namely Alerting and Orienting (Categorical Search Task) and Executive Control (Stroop Task and Eriksen Flanker Task). We explored whether they are influenced by gene variants affecting adenosine metabolism or catecholamine receptors. We recruited 106 healthy male subjects who were administered, in a double-blind design, 40mL of either a decaffeinated coffee preparation plus 3mg/kg caffeine (caf) or the corresponding vehicle (decaf). The protocol was repeated 24h later with the alternative preparation. Cognitive tasks were performed between 30min and 2h after caf or decaf administration. Each subject underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for 2h. Blood samples were collected for genetic evaluations and for plasma caffeine and catecholamines measures. We found a significant reduction of reaction times in two of the cognitive tasks (Categorical Search Task and Stroop Task) after caf compared with decaf, indicating that caffeine, on average, improved the attention level in the domains under investigation. We also found, however, a great inter-individual variability in the cognitive performance responses to caffeine. In exploring genetic sources for such variability, we found a relation between polymorphisms of adenosine A2A and the caffeine effects on the attentional domains of Orienting and Executive control. In conclusion, variability in the attentional response to coffee may be partly explained by genetic polymorphisms of adenosine and adrenergic receptors.",

Over a 14-year period, drug liver metabolism, using caffeine as a probe drug, has been systematically carried out in addition to the usual clinical, histological and biochemical investigations performed in patients with PBC. The \"Caffeine test\" consisted of a 200 mg caffeine oral intake. Urines were collected over 24 hours: caffeine (137X), 1-7-dimethylxanthine (17X), 1-3-dimethylxanthine (13X), 1-3-dimethylurate (13U), 3-7-dimethylxanthine (37X), 1-7-dimethylurate (17U), 1-methylxanthine (1X), 1-methylurate (1U), 7-methylxanthine (7X), 3-methylxanthine (3X), and 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracyl (AFMU) were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Total and individual metabolite urinary elimination rates were expressed in micromol/24 hours. Enzyme activities were evaluated from the following urinary metabolite ratios: (AFMU+1U+1X)/17U for CYP1A2, 17U/17X for CYP2A6, AFMU/(AFMU+U+ 1X) for NAT-2, 1U/1X for XO. Compared to healthy subjects, patients with PBC presented a reduced metabolism of caffeine due to a decreased CYP1A2 activity, all the more important since the patients had an advanced histological stage. This picture was nearly identical to the observed picture in chronic liver diseases from various origins. PBC affected the various metabolic pathways of caffeine in a differential manner. CYP1A2 activity was decreased but XO and mainly CYP2A6 activities were increased as shown by the raised urinary ratio 17U/total metabolite elimination. In contrast to the described loss of bimodality of the NAT-2 index distribution in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, we found a clear-cut, bimodal distribution in patients with PBC, without a high incidence of slow acetylator status. Metabolism of caffeine is strongly and differentially disturbed in patients with PBC and apparently not exactly in the same way as that in alcoholic cirrhosis which is more often taken as an index of chronic liver disease. This suggests the need for caution with medicines whose metabolism is under polygenic regulation. Because of the relationships between caffeine metabolism modifications and histological stages, the caffeine test might be used along with the usual tests to safely follow-up the evolution of the disease.",

Although the inter-individuals variability in the caffeine metabolism is known, the relation of caffeine metabolites with hypertension remains unsettled. We examined the association of caffeine and 13 direct and indirect caffeine metabolites with hypertension in U.S. adults. Using data from 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we included 2278 individuals aged 18 to 80 years. Urinary methyluric acids (MU) and methylxanthines (MX) products of caffeine metabolism were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. We used multivariate logistic regression to model hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265130\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u226580\u2009mmHg) as functions of urinary coffee metabolites. The odds of hypertension decreased across quartiles of 3-MU, 7-MU, 3-MX and 7-MX, with 7-MU being the more powerful metabolite. Compared with adults in the bottom quartile of 7-MU, the odds of hypertension decreased by 81% (95% CI: -90 to -22%) in those in the upper quartile. In contrast, the odds ratio for being hypertensive from the bottom to the upper quartile were 4.47 (95% CI: 1.21-16.50) for 1,3-dimethyluric acid, 4.45 (95% CI: 1.48-13.39) for 1,3-dimethylxanthine, and 5.08 (95% CI: 1.11-23.36) for 1,7-dimethylxanthine. Neither insulin resistance nor abdominal obesity were moderators in these associations. Final metabolites of caffeine (namely 3-MU, 7-MU, 3-MX and 7-MX), but not caffeine, significantly reduce the odds for hypertension in this population.",

          "content": "Following critical evaluation of the available literature to date, The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) position regarding caffeine intake is as follows: 1. Supplementation with caffeine has been shown to acutely enhance various aspects of exercise performance in many but not all studies. Small to moderate benefits of caffeine use include, but are not limited to: muscular endurance, movement velocity and muscular strength, sprinting, jumping, and throwing performance, as well as a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic sport-specific actions. 2. Aerobic endurance appears to be the form of exercise with the most consistent moderate-to-large benefits from caffeine use, although the magnitude of its effects differs between individuals. 3. Caffeine has consistently been shown to improve exercise performance when consumed in doses of 3-6\u2009mg/kg body mass. Minimal effective doses of caffeine currently remain unclear but they may be as low as 2\u2009mg/kg body mass. Very high doses of caffeine (e.g. 9\u2009mg/kg) are associated with a high incidence of side-effects and do not seem to be required to elicit an ergogenic effect. 4. The most commonly used timing of caffeine supplementation is 60\u2009min pre-exercise. Optimal timing of caffeine ingestion likely depends on the source of caffeine. For example, as compared to caffeine capsules, caffeine chewing gums may require a shorter waiting time from consumption to the start of the exercise session. 5. Caffeine appears to improve physical performance in both trained and untrained individuals. 6. Inter-individual differences in sport and exercise performance as well as adverse effects on sleep or feelings of anxiety following caffeine ingestion may be attributed to genetic variation associated with caffeine metabolism, and physical and psychological response. Other factors such as habitual caffeine intake also may play a role in between-individual response variation. 7. Caffeine has been shown to be ergogenic for cognitive function, including attention and vigilance, in most individuals. 8. Caffeine may improve cognitive and physical performance in some individuals under conditions of sleep deprivation. 9. The use of caffeine in conjunction with endurance exercise in the heat and at altitude is well supported when dosages range from 3 to 6\u2009mg/kg and 4-6\u2009mg/kg, respectively. 10. Alternative sources of caffeine such as caffeinated chewing gum, mouth rinses, energy gels and chews have been shown to improve performance, primarily in aerobic exercise. 11. Energy drinks and pre-workout supplements containing caffeine have been demonstrated to enhance both anaerobic and aerobic performance.",

          "title": "Muscle carnosine metabolism and beta-alanine supplementation in relation to exercise and training.",
          "content": "Carnosine is a dipeptide with a high concentration in mammalian skeletal muscle. It is synthesized by carnosine synthase from the amino acids L-histidine and beta-alanine, of which the latter is the rate-limiting precursor, and degraded by carnosinase. Recent studies have shown that the chronic oral ingestion of beta-alanine can substantially elevate (up to 80%) the carnosine content of human skeletal muscle. Interestingly, muscle carnosine loading leads to improved performance in high-intensity exercise in both untrained and trained individuals. Although carnosine is not involved in the classic adenosine triphosphate-generating metabolic pathways, this suggests an important role of the dipeptide in the homeostasis of contracting muscle cells, especially during high rates of anaerobic energy delivery. Carnosine may attenuate acidosis by acting as a pH buffer, but improved contractile performance may also be obtained by improved excitation-contraction coupling and defence against reactive oxygen species. High carnosine concentrations are found in individuals with a high proportion of fast-twitch fibres, because these fibres are enriched with the dipeptide. Muscle carnosine content is lower in women, declines with age and is probably lower in vegetarians, whose diets are deprived of beta-alanine. Sprint-trained athletes display markedly high muscular carnosine, but the acute effect of several weeks of training on muscle carnosine is limited. High carnosine levels in elite sprinters are therefore either an important genetically determined talent selection criterion or a result of slow adaptation to years of training. beta-Alanine is rapidly developing as a popular ergogenic nutritional supplement for athletes worldwide, and the currently available scientific literature suggests that its use is evidence based. However, many aspects of the supplement, such as the potential side effects and the mechanism of action, require additional and thorough investigation by the sports science community.",

          "content": "Beta-alanine has become a dietary supplement widely used by athletes due to its ergogenic effect. However, there is still no consensus on the performance benefit of beta-alanine on exercise lasting longer than ten minutes. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of beta-alanine supplementation on running performance and the expression of TauT and PAT1. This double-blind, randomized study enrolled 16 long-distance runners (37\u00b18 years) who were randomly allocated to two groups: placebo (PLA) and beta-alanine (BA) (4.8 g/day 1) for four weeks. Maximal oxygen consumption, anthropometry, body composition, and food intake were determined. Before and after the intervention, the athletes undertook a 5000 m running time trial. Venous blood (TauT and PAT1 expressions) and ear lobe capillary blood (lactate) collected before and after exercise. Between tests, we monitored the training variables. The results were analyzed by t-tests and an ANOVA of repeated measures, with Sidak's post hoc (P<0.05). PLA exhibited lower body fat than BA (8.7\u00b12.2 vs. 11.5\u00b12.8%, P=0.04). After supplementation, there was an increase in PAT1 expression in BA when compared to PLA (1.17\u00b10.47 vs. 0.77\u00b10.18, P=0.04). No significant differences were shown for the 5000 m running time in PLA (PRE: 1128\u00b172; POST: 1123\u00b172s) and BA (PRE: 1107\u00b195; POST: 1093\u00b186s). Although beta-alanine supplementation increased PAT1 expression, there was no statistically significant improvement in 5000 m running performance. However, individual responses should be considered as the BA showed a higher delta than the PLA.",

          "content": "This study examined the effects of an oral nutritional supplement fortified with two different doses of beta-alanine on body composition, muscle function and physical capacity in older adults. Using a double-blind placebo controlled design, 60 men and women (age \u00b1 SD = 70.7 \u00b1 6.2 yrs) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 1) oral nutritional supplement (ONS; n = 20) (8 oz; 230 kcal; 12 g PRO; 31 g CHO; 6 g FAT), 2) ONS plus 800 mg beta-alanine (ONS800; n = 19), and 3) ONS plus 1200 mg beta-alanine (ONS1200; n = 21). Treatments were consumed twice per day for 12 weeks. At pre- and post-supplementation period, participants performed a discontinuous, submaximal cycle ergometry test to determine physical working capacity at fatigue threshold (PWCFT). Fat mass, total body and arm lean soft tissue mass (ALSTM) were measured with DEXA while muscle strength was assessed with handgrip dynamometry (GRIP) and 30-s sit-to-stand (STS) was used to measure lower body functionality. Muscle quality (MQ) was calculated with GRIPmax and DEXA derived ALSTM [GRIP (kg)\u00b7ALSTM (kg)(-1)]. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare pre- to post-supplementation measures and group differences. There were 16 dropouts over the duration of the study. Final group sizes were ONS = 16 (m = 11, w = 5), ONS800 = 15 (m = 5, w = 10), and ONS1200 = 13 (m = 6, w = 7). No significant changes were observed for body composition or GRIP values pre to post. Significant increases in PW(CFT) were seen in ONS1200 (13.6%) and ONS800 (17.8%) pre- to post-supplementation (p < 0.05). These changes were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the changes in ONS (-6.3%). ONS1200 and ONS had significant increases in STS (22.2 and 10.7%, respectively). While ONS significantly increased in STS, no differences (p > 0.05) in change scores were found between ONS and ONS800. ONS fortified with beta-alanine may improve physical working capacity, muscle quality and function in older men and women. These findings could have importance in the perception of frailty, and the maintenance of health and independent living in older adults.",

A search strategy was developed in accordance with the standards for the reporting of scientific literature via systematic reviews. Five databases were thoroughly searched from inception to November 2012. Inclusion criteria were English language, human studies, used BA to increase exercise or athletic performance, systematic reviews or randomized controlled trials and were published in a peer-reviewed journal. Included studies were systematically graded for their methodological quality by rotating pairs of reviewers and the results were qualitatively synthesized. One systematic review and 19 randomized trials were included in this review. There is one systematic review with several methodological weaknesses that limit the confidence in its results. There are moderate to high quality studies that appear to support that BA may increase power output and working capacity, decrease the feeling of fatigue and exhaustion, and have of positive effect on body composition and carnosine content. The reporting of side effects from BA supplementation in the athletic population was generally under-reported. There appears to be some evidence from this review that supplementation with BA may increase athletic performance. However, there is insufficient evidence examining the safety of BA supplementation and its side effects. It is therefore recommended to err on the side of caution in using BA as an ergogenic aid until there is sufficient evidence confirming its safety.",

          "content": "Moderate altitudes carry physiological and metabolic changes that can dampen exercise performance. Fortunately, these changes can be modulated by an optimal nutritional intervention. This case study represents the first nutritional intervention of a moderate altitude athlete. These results may help to establish well-designed nutritional guidelines for moderate altitude sports athletes. This case study examined the effects of a 11-week nutritional intervention on body composition, muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, resting and exercise nutrient oxidation, and subjective sleep quality, in a male high-level moderate altitude athlete with a very light non-exercise activity thermogenesis. During the 11-week of nutritional intervention, 2800-3500 kcal/day, 6.8-8.9\u00a0g/kg/day of carbohydrates, 1.2-1.7\u00a0g/kg/day of protein, and 1-2.5\u00a0g/kg/day of fat were prescribed. Different specific considerations were also included, such as: iron supplementation, antioxidants increment in different phases, and ergogenic aids (i.e. creatine and beta-alanine). Our results demonstrated a decrease in adiposity and an increase in fat-free mass. In parallel, the athlete improved muscle strength, and therefore endurance adaptations after a maximal effort test (i.e. enhancement of the heart rate recovery). After the intervention, the athlete not only increased the carbohydrate oxidation during exercise and resting conditions but also improved his subjective sleep quality. Our results suggest that a nutritional intervention based on the endurance nutritional recommendations and adapted to the altitude physiological peculiarities can induce body re-composition, improve physiological adaptations to effort, and upgrade the substrate oxidation in a moderate altitude high-level athletes.",

          "content": "The timing of macronutrient ingestion in relation to exercise is a purported strategy to augment muscle accretion, muscle and athletic performance, and recovery. To date, the majority of macronutrient nutrient timing research has focused on carbohydrate and protein intake. However, emerging research suggests that the strategic ingestion of various ergogenic aids and micronutrients may also have beneficial effects. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative review is to critically evaluate and summarize the available literature examining the timing of ergogenic aids (caffeine, creatine, nitrates, sodium bicarbonate, beta-alanine) and micronutrients (iron, calcium) on muscle adaptations and exercise performance. In summary, preliminary data is available to indicate the timing of caffeine, nitrates, and creatine monohydrate may impact outcomes such as exercise performance, strength gains and other exercise training adaptations. Furthermore, data is available to suggest that timing the administration of beta-alanine and sodium bicarbonate may help to minimize known untoward adverse events while maintaining potential ergogenic outcomes. Finally, limited data indicates that timed ingestion of calcium and iron may help with the uptake and metabolism of these nutrients. While encouraging, much more research is needed to better understand how timed administration of these nutrients and others may impact performance, health, or other exercise training outcomes.",

          "content": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic noncommunicable disorder characterized by a constellation of symptoms that include fatigue, depression and chronic pain. FM affects 2%-8% of the U.S. population, 2% of the global population, with 61%-90% of FM diagnoses attributed to women. Key causal factors leading to the development and severity of FM-related symptoms have not yet been identified. The purpose of this article is to report relationships among identified metabolites and levels of fatigue, depression, pain severity, and pain interference in a sample of 20 women with FM. In this secondary analysis, we conducted global metabolomic analysis and examined the data for relationships of metabolite levels with self-reported symptoms of fatigue, depression, pain severity, and pain interference. Results revealed six metabolites (6-deoxy-hexose; pantothenic acid; ergothioneine; l-carnitine; n-acetylserotonin; butyrobetaine) and their associated metabolic pathways such as carnitine synthesis, lipid oxidation, tryptophan metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism and pantothenic and Coenzyme-A biosynthesis that were either positively or inversely related to pain severity, pain interference, or both. The preliminary data presented suggest that metabolites representing energy, amino acid, or lipid classification may be associated with pain symptom severity and interference in women with FM. Future work will confirm these findings in a large, comparative cohort, targeting metabolites and metabolite pathways to better understand the relationships of metabolites and symptomology.",

          "content": "Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation increases exercise performance due to increases in the intramuscular lactate buffer, carnosine. Females are more sensitive to these increases and results are further pronounced in trained individuals. Baseline intramuscular carnosine levels also naturally decrease with age; therefore, trained older females may experience augmented benefits from BA supplementation. However, the ability of BA to increase lower-body isokinetic strength (ISO) in female masters athletes (MA) is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal effects of BA supplementation on ISO, handgrip strength (HG), and body composition in female MA cyclists. Twenty-two subjects participated in this double-blind randomized study. Subjects were randomized into 2 groups (placebo [PLA] = 8 g dextrose; BA = 800 mg + 8 g dextrose) and supplemented 4 times per day for 28 days. ISO, HG, and body composition were evaluated at baseline and at the same day/time each week over the 28-day intervention. No differences existed between groups at baseline or at the 7, 14, and 21 days time points for any variables (p > 0.05). When evaluating ISO (isokinetic) after 28 days, total work performed during the final third of the assessment (24.0 vs. -16.8% change) in flexion and average peak torque (5.4 vs. 2.9% change) in extension were significantly increased from baseline in BA compared with PLA (p \u2264 0.05). No differences existed for HG or body composition after supplementation. Twenty-eight days of BA supplementation increased peak torque and work completed, indicating BA improves lower-body exercise performance in female MA.",

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of supplementation with T+ (SUP; Onnit Labs, Austin, TX, USA), an MIPS containing long jack root, beta-alanine, and branched-chain amino acids, and other proprietary blends, on strength, body composition, and hormones in young resistance-trained men. Subjects were randomized to consume either T+ (SUP; n = 14; age, 21 \u00b1 3 years; body fat, 18.3 \u00b1 4.7%) or an isocaloric placebo (PL; n = 13; age, 21 \u00b1 3 years; body fat, 21.5 \u00b1 6.2%) for 4 weeks. Both groups underwent a progressive, 4-week high-intensity resistance training protocol. Before and after the training protocol, mood state, body composition, blood hormones (also collected at midpoint), and maximal strength were measured. SUP had significantly greater increases in bench press (SUP, 102 \u00b1 16 kg to 108 \u00b1 16 kg vs. PL, 96 \u00b1 22 kg to 101 \u00b1 22 kg; p < 0.001) and total weight lifted (SUP, 379 \u00b1 59 kg to 413 \u00b1 60 kg vs. PL, 376 \u00b1 70 kg to 400 \u00b1 75 kg; p < 0.001) compared with PL. Additionally, deadlift strength relative to total body mass (calculated as weight lifted/body mass; kg:kg) (2.08 \u00b1 0.18 to 2.23 \u00b1 0.16; p = 0.036) and lean mass (2.55 \u00b1 0.19 to 2.72 \u00b1 0.16; p = 0.021) increased significantly in SUP but not PL (2.02 \u00b1 0.30 to 2.15 \u00b1 0.36 and 2.56 \u00b1 0.31 to 2.70 \u00b1 0.36, respectively). No other significant differences were detected between groups for the remaining variables. Supplementing with SUP enhanced resistance training adaptations independent of hormonal status, and thus SUP use may warrant inclusion into peri-workout nutrition regimens.

          "content": "Beta-alanine, caffeine, and nitrate are dietary supplements generally recognized by the sport and exercise science community as evidence-based ergogenic performance aids. Evidence supporting the efficacy of these supplements, however, is greatly skewed due to research being conducted primarily in men. The physiological differences between men and women, most notably in sex hormones and menstrual cycle fluctuations, make generalizing male data to the female athlete inappropriate, and potentially harmful to women. This narrative review outlines the studies conducted in women regarding the efficacy of beta-alanine, caffeine, and nitrate supplementation for performance enhancement. Only nine studies on beta-alanine, 15 on caffeine, and 10 on nitrate in healthy women under the age of 40\u00a0years conducted in normoxia conditions were identified as relevant to this research question. Evidence suggests that beta-alanine may lower the rate of perceived exertion and extend training bouts in women, leading to greater functional adaptations. Studies of caffeine in women suggest the physiological responder status and caffeine habituation may contribute to caffeine's efficacy, with a potential plateau in the dose-response relationship of performance enhancement. Nitrate appears to vary in influence based on activity type and primary muscle group examined. However, the results summarized in the limited literature for each of these three supplements provide no consensus on dosage, timing, or efficacy for women. Furthermore, the literature lacks considerations for hormonal status and its role in metabolism. This gap in sex-based knowledge necessitates further research on these ergogenic supplements in women with greater considerations for the effects of hormonal status.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of beta-alanine supplementation on body composition indices. Online databases, including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, were searched up to April 2021 to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which examined the effect of beta-alanine supplementation on body composition indices. Meta-analyses were carried out using a random-effects model. The I index was used to assess the heterogeneity of RCTs. Among the initial 1413 studies that were identified from electronic databases search, 20 studies involving 492 participants were eligible. Pooled effect size from 20 studies indicated that beta-alanine supplementation has no effect on body mass (WMD: -0.15 kg; 95% CI: -0.78 to 0.47;  =\u00a00.631, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.998), fat mass (FM) (WMD: -0.24 kg; 95% CI: -1.16 to 0.68;  =\u00a00.612, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.969), body fat percentage (BFP) (WMD: -0.06%; 95% CI: -0.53 to 0.40;  =\u00a00.782, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.936), and fat-free mass (FFM) (WMD: 0.05 kg; 95% CI: -0.71 to 0.82;  =\u00a00.889, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.912). Subgroup analyses based on exercise type (resistance training [RT], endurance training [ET], and combined training [CT]), study duration (<8 and \u22658\u00a0weeks), and beta-alanine dosage (<6 and \u22656\u00a0g/d) demonstrated similar results. Certainty of evidence across outcomes ranged from low to moderate. This meta-analysis study suggests that beta-alanine supplementation is unlikely to improve body composition indices regardless of supplementation dosage and its combination with exercise training. No studies have examined the effect of beta-alanine combined with both diet and exercise on body composition changes as the primary variable. Therefore, future studies examining the effect of the combination of beta-alanine supplementation with a hypocaloric diet and exercise programs are warranted.",

          "content": "Following an extensive literature review, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) has developed an official position on nutritional and weight cut strategies for combat sports. The type of combat sport, length of the fight camp, and time between weigh-in and competition are factors influencing nutritional and weight cut strategies. The following 16 points constitute the Position Statement of the Society; the Research Committee has approved them. 1. Combat sports have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and competition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and weight cut strategies for training and competition. 2. As the duration of a combat match increases, >4 min, contribution of the aerobic system can rise to\u2009>70%, yet anaerobic alactic pathways and anaerobic glycolytic pathways support high-output bursts. 3. During the off camp/general preparation phase, athletes should maintain a weight ranging 12% to 15% above the weight division requirement. 4. Supplements including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance performance and/or recovery during preparation phases, competition, and post-competition. 5. During fight camp, strategic decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an efficient longitudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be determined using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such as Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham. 6. Protein should be prioritized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean body mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports training demands. Macronutrients should not drop below the following: carbohydrates 3.0-4.0\u2009g/kg, protein 1.2-2.0\u2009g/kg, and fat 0.5 to 1.0\u2009g/kg/day. 7. Suitable losses in body mass range from 6.7% at 72\u00a0h, 5.7% at 48\u00a0h, and 4.4% at 24\u00a0h, prior to weigh-in. 8. Sodium restriction and water loading are effective for inducing polyuria and acute water loss. 9. During fight week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through exercise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1% to 2% loss in body mass, with equivalent losses from a low-fiber intake of <10\u2009g/day for 4\u2009days. 10. During fight week, acute water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immersion, and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate supervision (optimally ~2-4% of body mass within 24\u00a0h of weigh-in). 11. Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are utilized to recover lost body fluid/mass before competition with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage. 12. Oral rehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with a sodium range of 50-90\u2009mmol/dL should take precedence immediately post-weigh-in. 13. Fast-acting carbohydrates at a tolerable rate of\u2009\u2264\u200960 g/h should follow oral rehydration solutions. Post weigh-in intake of fiber should be limited to avoid gastrointestinal distress. 14. Post-weigh-in carbohydrate intake at 8-12\u2009g/kg may be appropriate for combat athletes that undertook significant glycogen depletion strategies during fight week. About 4-7\u2009g/kg may be suitable for modest carbohydrate restriction. 15. Post weigh-in, rehydration/refueling protocols should aim to regain\u2009\u226510% of body mass to mitigate declines in performance and the negative effects of rapid weight loss. 16. The long-term effects of frequent weight cuts on health and performance are unknown, necessitating further research.",

          "title": "Combined Effects of Citrulline Plus Nitrate-Rich Beetroot Extract Co-Supplementation on Maximal and Endurance-Strength and Aerobic Power in Trained Male Triathletes: A Randomized Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.",
          "content": "Citrulline (CIT) and nitrate-rich beetroot extract (BR) are ergogenic aids and nitric oxide (NO) precursors. In addition, both supplements seem to have other actions at the level of muscle metabolism that can benefit strength and aerobic power performance. Both supplements have been studied in numerous investigations in isolation. However, scientific evidence combining both supplements is scarce, and to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no current study of endurance athletes. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to determine the effect of 9 weeks of CIT plus BR supplementation on maximal and endurance-strength performance and aerobic power in male triathletes. This study was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where participants ( = 32) were randomized into four different groups: placebo group (PLG;  = 8), CIT plus BR group (CIT- BRG; 3 g/kg/day of CIT plus 3 mg/kg/day of nitrates (NO);  = 8), CIT group (CITG; 3 g/kg/day;  = 8) and BR group (BRG; 3 mg/kg/day of NO;  = 8). Before (T1) and after 9 weeks (T2), four physical condition tests were carried out in order to assess sport performance: the horizontal jump test (HJUMP), handgrip dynamometer test, 1-min abdominal tests (1-MAT) and finally, the Cooper test. Although, no significant interactions (time \u00d7 supplementation groups) were found for the strength tests ( > 0.05), the CIT- BRG supplementation presented a trend on HJUMP and 1-MAT tests confirmed by significant increase between two study moments in CIT-BRG. Likewise, CIT-BRG presented significant interactions in the aerobic power test confirmed by this group's improve estimated VO during the study with respect to the other study groups ( = 0.002; \u03b7p = 0.418). In summary, supplementing with 3 g/day of CIT and 2.1 g/day of BR (300 mg/day of NO) for 9 weeks could increase maximal and endurance strength. Furthermore, when compared to CIT or BR supplementation alone, this combination improved performance in tests related to aerobic power.",

          "title": "Impact of L-Citrulline Supplementation and HIIT on Lipid Profile, Arterial Stiffness, and Fat Mass in Obese Adolescents with Metabolic-Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.",
          "content": "Metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and obesity contribute to vascular dysfunction through oxidative stress, heightening cardiovascular risk. Oral supplementation with L-citrulline (L-cit), a precursor of L-arginine (L-arg) and nitric oxide, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) may improve vascular function and cardiometabolic health. This study aimed to evaluate the combined effects of L-cit supplementation and HIIT on arterial stiffness, body composition, glucose metabolism, lipid profile, and blood pressure (BP) in adolescents with MASLD and obesity. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05778266), 44 adolescents (15-19 years) with MASLD and obesity were assigned to HIIT + L-cit (n = 14), HIIT + placebo (n = 14), or L-cit (n = 15) for 12 weeks. HIIT sessions (85% and 60% peak heart rate during intense and recovery periods) occurred thrice weekly. Training volume progressively increased, and participants performed 20 min of HITT per session in the last 8 weeks. Outcomes included pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (Aix75), VO2peak, body composition, BP, glucose and lipid profiles, and hepatic steatosis. Compared to L-cit, HIIT + L-cit improved non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( = 0.04), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( = 0.01), triglycerides ( = 0.02), and VO2peak ( = 0.001). No significant between-group changes were found in PWV, AIx75, hepatic steatosis, and body composition. HIIT + placebo improved VO2peak ( = 0.002), and L-cit decreased the degree of steatosis ( = 0.038). HIIT + L-cit supplementation enhanced lipid profile and cardiorespiratory fitness, while HIIT + placebo improved cardiorespiratory capacity, and L-cit alone decreased hepatic steatosis. Thus, L-cit could be an adjuvant strategy to manage obesity-related MASLD in adolescents.",

Acute citrulline-malate supplementation increases total work in short lower-body isokinetic tasks for recreationally active females during menstruation. J Strength Cond Res 37(6): 1225-1230, 2023-Citrulline-malate (CM) exhibits acute ergogenic benefits through nitric oxide production (NO) and augmentation of vasodilatory properties. Nitric oxide is upregulated by estrogen and may influence CM's ergogenic efficacy in women. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of CM supplementation on lower-body isokinetic performance in recreationally active women. Nineteen women (23.5 \u00b1 3.1 years; 164.8 \u00b1 7.0 cm; 61.9 \u00b1 27.4 kg; 28.8 \u00b1 8.1% body fat) completed 2 randomized, double-blind, crossover trials consuming CM (8 g CM + 12 g dextrose) or placebo (12 g dextrose). For testing trials, subjects were in the menstruating portion of the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Subjects performed a 5-repetition isokinetic leg extension protocol (5RP) followed by a 50-repetition isokinetic leg extension protocol (50RP), 60 minutes after supplement consumption. Repeated measures analysis of variance analysis showed that CM significantly increased total work completed, relative total work, and total work during maximum repetition compared with placebo ( p < 0.05); but no significant performance differences existed between trials for peak torque production ( p = 0.14) for the 5RP. No significant differences were identified between trials for peak torque production ( p = 0.69 ) or total work ( p = 0.33) completed during the 50RP. CM increased total work completed during the 5RP, but provided no ergogenic benefit during the 50RP in recreationally active menstruating women. CM amplifies power-based resistance exercise performance in women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, potentially because of depressed estrogen levels. Additional research is needed to identify timing efficacy of CM to increase sport performance during each phase of the menstrual cycle.",

          "content": "The combined exercise with citrulline (CIT) supplementation is a potential adjuvant treatment approach to address the declining body composition and lower limb function of overweight older adults. However, research on this approach is limited. Thus, this study performed a meta-analysis review to explore the effects of combined exercise with CIT supplementation on body composition and lower limb function among overweight older adults. The search strategy and manuscript development of this study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Eligible studies were first searched through four databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and EBSCO) from January 2003 until April 2023, followed by screening. The main inclusion criteria for the article selection are as follows: 1) Randomized Controlled Trial studies; 2) Participants aged over 55; 3) Studies involved exercise with CIT supplementation for the experimental group and exercise with Placebo (PLA) supplementation for the control group; 4) Body composition and lower limb function were measured at pre- and post-intervention. Subsequently, the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was utilized to evaluate the selected studies' quality. The Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) was chosen as the suitable effect scale index, and the mean differences of the data from the selected articles were analyzed using Revman 5.4 software with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI). A total of seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were selected for the meta-analysis. The included studies involved 105 males and 198 females, where 157 belonged to the PLA group and 146 from the CIT group. Significant improvements were observed among overweight older adults with CIT supplementation in 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) (P = 0.04, I = 4%), SMD (95% CI) = -0.28 (-0.54, -0.01), and Lower Limb Strength (LLS) (P < 0.01, I = 30%), SMD (95% CI) = -0.38 (-0.65, -0.12) compared to those with PLA supplementation. Combined exercise with CIT supplementation could be an effective non-pharmaceutical intervention to improve the physical function of overweight older adults by increasing their muscle strength.",

However, its influence on metabolic outcomes such as whole-body volumes of oxygen consumption (VO) and carbon dioxide production (VCO), substrate oxidation, energy expenditure (EE), and gross efficiency remains unknown. We studied the effects of 1\u00a0week of daily co-supplementation of 3.5\u00a0g BR (500\u00a0mg NO) plus 6\u00a0g CIT on VO and VCO kinetics, substrate utilization, EE, and gross efficiency in elite male rowers compared to a placebo and to a BR supplementation.

Preoperative and 1-year postoperative assessments included citrulline, I-FABP, glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and C peptide levels. Significant weight loss and T2DM remission (11/21) were observed post-SG. Preoperatively, patients had low citrulline and high I-FABP levels, which normalized postoperatively. A positive correlation was found between the I-FABP/citrulline ratio and weight, BMI, glucose, insulin, and C peptide levels. SG not only induces enterocyte dysfunction and mass recovery but also may facilitate T2DM remission and alleviate obesity-related effects on the enteroendocrine system. These findings highlight the potential beneficial effects of SG on enteroendocrine function in obese patients.",

          "content": "Post-polio syndrome (PPS) is a condition that affects polio survivors years after recovery from an initial acute infection by the Poliomyelitis virus. Most often, patients who suffered from polio start to experience gradual new weakening in muscles, a gradual decrease in the size of muscles (muscle atrophy) and fatigue years after the acute illness. L-citrulline is known to change muscular metabolism synthesis by raising nitric oxide (NO) levels and increasing protein synthesis. This investigator-initiated, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, trial aims to demonstrate that L-citrulline positively influences muscle function and increases muscular energy production in patients with PPS. Thirty ambulant PPS patients will be recruited in Switzerland. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two arms of the study (placebo:verum 1:1). After a 24-week run-in phase to observe natural disease history and progression, participants will be treated either with L-citrulline or placebo for 24\u00a0weeks. The primary endpoint is change in the 6-min Walking Distance Test. Secondary endpoints will include motor function measure, quantitative muscle force, quantitative muscle magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy and serum biomarker laboratory analysis DISCUSSION: The aim of this phase IIa trial is to determine if treatment with L-citrulline shows a positive effect on clinical function and paraclinical biomarkers in PPS. If treatment with L-citrulline shows positive effects, this might represent a cost-efficient symptomatic therapy for PPS patients. ClinicalTrial.gov, ID: NCT02801071 . Registered on 6 June 2016.",

As a result, in response to resistance training (RT) these responses may establish a role for GSH\u2009+\u2009L-citrulline to increase muscle mass. This study attempted to determine the effects of an 8-week RT program in conjunction with GSH (Setria\u00ae)\u2009+\u2009L-citrulline, L-citrulline-malate, or placebo supplementation on lean mass and its association with muscle strength. The secondary purpose was to assess the safety of such supplementation protocol by assessing clinical chemistry markers. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 75 resistance-trained males were randomly assigned to ingest GSH\u2009+\u2009L-citrulline (GSH\u2009+\u2009CIT), L-citrulline-malate, or cellulose placebo daily while also participating in 8\u00a0weeks of RT. The full dose of each supplement was delivered in capsules that were identical in weight, size, shape, and color. Participants completed testing sessions for body composition and muscle strength before and after 4 and 8\u00a0weeks of RT and supplementation. Venous blood samples were obtained before and after 8\u00a0weeks. Leg press was increased with RT but was not significantly different between groups (p\u2009>\u20090.05); however, bench press strength was not increased with RT (p\u2009>\u20090.05). There were no significant changes in total body mass, fat mass, or total body water during 8\u00a0weeks of RT and supplementation. Lean mass increased in both GSH\u2009+\u2009CIT when compared to PLC; however, the increase was significant only after 4\u00a0weeks. Lean mass and strength were positively correlated (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in GSH\u2009+\u2009CIT, but not CIT-malate or PLC. Neither RT nor supplementation had any significant effects on blood clinical chemistry variables (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Compared to PLC, supplementation of GSH\u2009+\u2009CIT during resistance training increased lean mass after 4\u00a0weeks of RT and was positively associated with muscle strength.

Our purpose was to research the effects of CIT supplementation on protein metabolism in particular on non-oxidative leucine disposal (NOLD, primary endpoint), and splanchnic extraction of amino acids in malnourished older patients. This prospective randomized multicenter study determined whole-body and liver protein synthesis, splanchnic protein metabolism and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM) in 24 malnourished older patients [80-92 years; 18 women and 6 men] in inpatient rehabilitation units. All received an oral dose of 10\u00a0g of CIT or an equimolar mixture of six non-essential amino acids (NEAAs), as isonitrogenous placebo, for 3 weeks. NOLD and albumin fractional synthesis rates were not different between the NEAA and CIT groups. Splanchnic extraction of dietary amino acid tended to decrease (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09) in the CIT group (45.2%) compared with the NEAA group (60.3%). Total differences in AA and NEAA area under the curves between fed-state and postabsorptive-state were significantly higher in the CIT than in the NEAA group. There were no significant differences for body mass index, fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM) or ASMM in the whole population except for a tendential decrease in FM for the citrulline group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.089). Compared with Day 1, lean mass and ASMM significantly increased (respectively p\u00a0=\u00a00.016 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) at Day 20 in CIT-treated women (mean respective increase of 1.7\u00a0kg and 1.1\u00a0kg), and fat mass significantly decreased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) at Day 20 in CIT-group women (mean decrease of 1.3\u00a0kg). Our results demonstrate that CIT supplementation has no effect on whole-body protein synthesis or liver protein synthesis in malnourished older subjects. However, CIT supplementation was associated with a higher systemic AA availability. In the subgroup of women, CIT supplementation increased LM and ASMM, and decreased FM.",

J Strength Cond Res 33(9): 2321-2329, 2019-Citrulline malate (CitMal) and beetroot juice (BEET) are increasingly popular ergogenic aids, but few studies have rigorously investigated their effects on resistance exercise performance and underlying mechanisms. The current randomized, double-blind, crossover study evaluated the effects of CitMal and BEET supplementation on blood flow, metabolic efficiency, and performance during maximal isokinetic leg extension exercise. After familiarization, 27 recreationally active men (age: 22 \u00b1 4 years) completed 3 visits in which subjects ingested a treatment beverage (CitMal [8 g], BEET [400-mg nitrate], or placebo [PLA]), followed by a 2-hour rest period, warm-up, and 5 sets of 30 concentric leg extensions. Before and after exercise, ultrasound was used to measure diameter (aDIAM) and blood flow (aBF) of the superficial femoral artery, along with cross-sectional area and echo intensity of the vastus lateralis. Plasma analytes (lactate, nitrate/nitrite [NOx], and urea nitrogen [BUN]) were also assessed at these times, and indirect calorimetry was used to measure energy expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio before and during exercise. Resting NOx values were higher in BEET (233.2 \u00b1 1.1 \u03bcmol\u00b7L) compared with CitMal (15.3 \u00b1 1.1, p < 0.0001) and PLA (13.4 \u00b1 1.1, p < 0.0001). Postexercise NOx values, adjusted for resting differences, were higher in BEET (86.3 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcmol\u00b7L) than CitMal (21.3 \u00b1 1.1, p < 0.0001) and PLA (18.1 \u00b1 1.1, p < 0.0001).

          "content": "Elevated serum ferritin has been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and adverse health outcomes in subjects with the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). As the mechanisms underlying the negative impact of excess iron have so far remained elusive, we aimed to identify potential links between iron homeostasis and metabolic pathways. In a cross-sectional study, data were obtained from 163 patients, allocated to one of three groups: (1) lean, healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a053), (2) MetS without hyperferritinemia (n\u00a0=\u00a054) and (3) MetS with hyperferritinemia (n\u00a0=\u00a056). An additional phlebotomy study included 29 patients with biopsy-proven iron overload before and after iron removal. A detailed clinical and biochemical characterization was obtained and metabolomic profiling was performed via a targeted metabolomics approach. Subjects with MetS and elevated ferritin had higher fasting glucose (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), HbA1c (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035) and 1\u00a0h glucose in oral glucose tolerance test (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) compared to MetS subjects without iron overload, whereas other clinical and biochemical features of the MetS were not different. The metabolomic study revealed significant differences between MetS with high and low ferritin in the serum concentrations of sarcosine, citrulline and particularly long-chain phosphatidylcholines. Methionine, glutamate, and long-chain phosphatidylcholines were significantly different before and after phlebotomy (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for all metabolites). Our data suggest that high serum ferritin concentrations are linked to impaired glucose homeostasis in subjects with the MetS. Iron excess is associated to distinct changes in the serum concentrations of phosphatidylcholine subsets. A pathway involving sarcosine and citrulline also may be involved in iron-induced impairment of glucose metabolism.",

          "content": "Cold exposure increases blood pressure (BP) and salivary flow rate (SFR). Increased cold-induced SFR would be hypothesized to enhance oral nitrate delivery for reduction to nitrite by oral anaerobes and to subsequently elevate plasma [nitrite] and nitric oxide bioavailability. We tested the hypothesis that dietary nitrate supplementation would increase plasma [nitrite] and lower BP to a greater extent in cool compared with normothermic conditions. Twelve males attended the laboratory on four occasions. Baseline measurements were completed at 28\u00b0C. Subsequently, participants ingested 140 mL of concentrated nitrate-rich (BR; \u223c13 mmol nitrate) or nitrate-depleted (PL) beetroot juice. Measurements were repeated over 3 h at either 28\u00b0C (Norm) or 20\u00b0C (Cool). Mean skin temperature was lowered compared with baseline in PL-Cool and BR-Cool. SFR was greater in BR-Norm, PL-Cool, and BR-Cool than PL-Norm. Plasma [nitrite] at 3 h was higher in BR-Cool (592\u2009\u00b1\u2009239 nM) versus BR-Norm (410\u2009\u00b1\u2009195 nM). Systolic BP (SBP) at 3 h was not different between PL-Norm (117\u2009\u00b1\u20096 mmHg) and BR-Norm (113\u2009\u00b1\u20099 mmHg). SBP increased above baseline at 1, 2, and 3 h in PL-Cool but not BR-Cool. These results suggest that BR consumption is more effective at increasing plasma [nitrite] in cool compared with normothermic conditions and blunts the rise in BP following acute cool air exposure, which might have implications for attenuating the increased cardiovascular strain in the cold. Compared with normothermic conditions, acute nitrate ingestion increased plasma [nitrite], a substrate for oxygen-independent nitric oxide generation, to a greater extent during cool air exposure. Systolic blood pressure was increased during cool air exposure in the placebo condition with this cool-induced blood pressure increase attenuated after acute nitrate ingestion. These findings improve our understanding of environmental factors that influence nitrate metabolism and the efficacy of nitrate supplementation to lower blood pressure.",

          "content": "While it is well established that dietary nitrate reduces the metabolic cost of exercise, recent evidence suggests this effect is maintained 24\u00a0h following the final nitrate dose when plasma nitrite levels have returned to baseline. In addition, acute dietary nitrate was recently reported to enhance peak power production. Our purpose was to examine whether chronic dietary nitrate supplementation enhanced peak power 24\u00a0h following the final dose and if this impacted performance in a heavily power-dependent sport. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover design, maximal aerobic capacity, body composition, strength, maximal power (30\u00a0s Wingate), endurance (2\u00a0km rowing time trial), and CrossFit performance (Grace protocol) were assessed before and after six days of supplementation with nitrate (NO) (8\u00a0mmol\u00b7potassium nitrate\u00b7d) or a non-caloric placebo (PL). A 10-day washout period divided treatment conditions. Paired -tests were utilized to assess changes over time and to compare changes between treatments. Peak Wingate power increased significantly over time with NO (889.17\u2009\u00b1\u2009179.69\u00a0W to 948.08\u2009\u00b1\u2009186.80\u00a0W; \u2009=\u20090.01) but not PL (898.08\u2009\u00b1\u2009183.24\u00a0W to 905.00\u2009\u00b1\u2009157.23\u00a0W; \u2009=\u20090.75). However, CrossFit performance was unchanged, and there were no changes in any other performance parameters. Consuming dietary nitrate in the potassium nitrate salt form improved peak power during a Wingate test, but did not improve elements of strength or endurance in male CrossFit athletes.",

          "content": "Studies utilizing beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation in trained populations are limited. No long-term studies utilizing HMB free acid (HMB-FA) have been conducted. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 12 weeks of HMB-FA supplementation on skeletal muscle hypertrophy, body composition, strength, and power in trained individuals. We also determined the effects of HMB-FA on muscle damage and performance during an overreaching cycle. A three-phase double-blind, placebo- and diet-controlled randomized intervention study was conducted. Phase 1 was an 8-week-periodized resistance-training program; Phase 2 was a 2-week overreaching cycle; and Phase 3 was a 2-week taper. Muscle mass, strength, and power were examined at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 to assess the chronic effects of HMB-FA; and assessment of these, as well as cortisol, testosterone, and creatine kinase (CK) was performed at weeks 9 and 10 of the overreaching cycle. HMB-FA resulted in increased total strength (bench press, squat, and deadlift combined) over the 12-week training (77.1 \u00b1 18.4 vs. 25.3 \u00b1 22.0 kg, p < 0.001); a greater increase in vertical jump power (991 \u00b1 168 vs. 630 \u00b1 167 W, p < 0.001); and increased lean body mass gain (7.4 \u00b1 4.2 vs. 2.1 \u00b1 6.1 kg, p < 0.001) in HMB-FA- and placebo-supplemented groups, respectively. During the overreaching cycle, HMB-FA attenuated increases in CK (-6 \u00b1 91 vs. 277 \u00b1 229 IU/l, p < 0.001) and cortisol (-0.2 \u00b1 2.9 vs. 4.5 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcg/dl, p < 0.003) in the HMB-FA- and placebo-supplemented groups, respectively. These results suggest that HMB-FA enhances hypertrophy, strength, and power following chronic resistance training, and prevents decrements in performance following the overreaching.",

          "content": "Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, is currently widely used in athletes to increase muscle mass and strength and has also been used as a nutritional supplement in recent years to maintain muscle mass in muscular atrophic diseases of older people. However, the effects of HMB supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function in older people remain controversial. The purpose of this review was to explore the effects of HMB on body composition in older adults. The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to obtain the randomized controlled trials needed as a basis for systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of 9 studies (448 participants) were eventually found eligible. The pooled results showed that HMB supplementation significantly increased fat-free mass in older people compared with the control group (effect size: 0.37; 95% Cl 0.16, 0.58; Z value\u2009=\u20093.47, P\u2009=\u20090.001; Fixed-effect model). But it had no effect on fat mass (effect size: -\u00a00.04 95% CI -\u00a00.26, 0.18; Z value\u2009=\u20090.36, P\u2009=\u20090.716, fixed-effect model). Subgroup analysis of HMB supplementation alone showed a significant improvement in fat-free mass in older people (effect size: 0.59; 95% CI 0.32, 0.87; Z\u2009=\u20094.24, P\u2009<\u20090.001; fixed-effect model), whereas HMB supplementation combined with exercise intervention showed no additional fat-free mass change (effect size: 0.06; 95% CI -\u00a00.26, 0.38; Z\u2009=\u20090.38, P\u2009=\u20090.705; Fixed-effect model). HMB supplementation is beneficial for improving body composition in older people. However, the effect of HMB supplementation combined with exercise therapy to improve muscle mass is not obvious. Exercise programs need to be designed according to the different physical health of older people.",

J Strength Cond Res 36(2): 585-592, 2022-The purpose of this article was to systematically review and meta-analyze the current literature to determine the effects of HMB on body composition in athletes. Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) were an experimental design published in a peer-reviewed, English-language journal; (b) included human athletic populations; (c) assessed body mass (BM), fat mass (FM), or fat-free mass (FFM) using a validated measure; (d) and had a minimum supplementation period of 4 weeks. Separate analyses were performed for BM, FM, and FFM using robust variance random-effects meta-regression for multilevel data structures, with adjustments for small samples. The final analysis of BM comprised a total of 208 subjects from 7 studies. Analysis of FFM and FM encompassed 5 studies comprising 161 subjects and 5 studies comprising 128 subjects, respectively. The principal finding of this analysis suggests HMB may have a small, positive impact on FFM in athletes (0.30 \u00b1 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.07 to 0.68; p = 0.08), although this seems specific to when protein intake is suboptimal (<1.6 g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1). Consistent with previous research on athletes, HMB demonstrated no significant effect on BM (-0.02 \u00b1 0.04; 95% CI: -0.14 to 0.10; p = 0.70) and a small, nonsignificant effect on FM (-0.33 \u00b1 0.23; 95% CI: -0.96 to 0.31; p = 0.22). More research is required to establish HMB's influence on FFM in athletes. It is also important to consider the dosage of HMB and training parameters of athletes because these will likely influence the efficacy of supplementation.",

After testing, the athletes were matched for fat-free mass and assigned to consume one of two supplementation regimens for 6\u2009weeks: 5\u2009g HMB\u2009+\u20095\u2009g creatine per day (HMB-Cr: 20.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009years; 177\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009cm; 88.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u2009kg) or 5\u2009g creatine +\u20095\u2009g placebo per day (Cr: 21.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009years; 179\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009cm; 88.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u2009kg). After 6\u2009weeks (POST), PRE testing was repeated in 13 of the original 16 athletes before a 10-wk wash-out period. Athletes who returned for the spring season (n\u2009=\u20098) repeated all fall-season procedures and testing prior to (PRE) and following (POST) their 6-wk spring season, except they were assigned to the opposite supplementation regimen. Linear mixed models with repeated measures revealed group x time interactions (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.05) for observed for several measures but did not consistently and positively favor one group. During the fall season, knee extensor peak torque was reduced by 40.7\u2009\u00b1\u200928.1\u2009Nm (p\u2009=\u20090.035) for HMB-Cr but remained consistent for Cr, and no group differences or changes were noted in the spring. In the spring, greater knee flexor rate of torque development (~\u2009149\u2009Nm\u00b7sec, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and impulse (~\u20094.5\u2009Nm\u00b7sec, p\u2009=\u20090.022) were observed in Cr at PRE but not at POST. Although significant interactions were found for cortisol concentrations, vastus lateralis pennation angle, and sprinting force, post-hoc analysis only revealed differences between fall and spring seasons. No other differences were observed. The combination of HMB and creatine monohydrate supplementation does not provide a greater ergogenic benefit compared to creatine monohydrate supplementation alone. Body composition, strength, and sprinting ability did not change across the season with creatine monohydrate supplementation.",

          "content": "Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a popular supplement in the resistance training community, with its use supported by claims of increased strength, muscle growth, and improved recovery; however, research outcomes are variable. Therefore, we meta-analyzed the effectiveness of HMB on strength, body composition, and muscle damage. Nine qualifying studies yielded 14 comparisons subcategorized by training experience (trained, untrained) to provide 12-13 estimates of strength (upper body, lower body, overall average), 13 estimates of fat and fat-free mass, and 7 estimates of the muscle-damage marker creatine kinase. The meta-analysis comprised 394 subjects (age 23 +/- 2 years, mean +/- between-study SD) with 5 +/- 2 weeks' intervention and 5 +/- 6 h.wk of training. The estimates were analyzed using a meta-analytic mixed model with study sample size as the weighting factor that included the main-effect covariates to control for between-study differences in HMB dose, intervention duration, training load, and dietary cointervention. To interpret magnitudes, meta-analyzed effects were standardized using the composite baseline between-subject SD and were qualified using modified Cohen effect size thresholds. There were small benefits to lower-body (mean +/- 90% confidence limit: 9.9% +/- 5.9%) and average strength (6.6 +/- 5.7%), but only negligible gains for upper-body strength (2.1 +/- 5.5%) were observed in untrained lifters. In trained lifters, all strength outcomes were trivial. Combined (all studies), the overall average strength increase was trivial (3.7 +/- 2.4%), although uncertainty allows for a small benefit. Effects on fat and fat-free mass were trivial, and results regarding creatine kinase were unclear. Supplementation with HMB during resistance training incurs small but clear overall and leg strength gains in previously untrained men, but effects in trained lifters are trivial. The HMB effect on body composition is inconsequential. An explanation for strength gains in previously untrained lifters requires further research.",

In study 1, subjects (n = 41) were randomized among three levels of HMB supplementation (0, 1.5 or 3.0 g HMB/day) and two protein levels (normal, 117 g/day, or high, 175 g/day) and weight lifted for 1.5 h 3 days/wk for 3 wk. In study 2, subjects (n = 28) were fed either 0 or 3.0 g HMB/day and weight lifted for 2-3 h 6 days/wk for 7 wk. In study 1, HMB significantly decreased the exercise-induced rise in muscle proteolysis as measured by urine 3-methylhistidine during the first 2 wk of exercise (linear decrease, P < 0.04). Plasma creatine phosphokinase was also decreased with HMB supplementation (week 3, linear decrease, P < 0.05). Weight lifted was increased by HMB supplementation when compared with the unsupplemented subjects during each week of the study (linear increase, P < 0.02). In study 2, fat-free mass was significantly increased in HMB-supplemented subjects compared with the unsupplemented group at 2 and 4-6 wk of the study (P < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation with either 1.5 or 3 g HMB/day can partly prevent exercise-induced proteolysis and/or muscle damage and result in larger gains in muscle function associated with resistance training.",

          "content": "Both regular exercise training and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation are shown as effective treatments to delay or reverse frailty and reduce cognitive impairment in older people. However, there is very little evidence on the true benefits of combining both strategies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantify the effects of exercise in addition to HMB supplementation, on physical and cognitive health in older adults. Data from 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of HMB supplementation and physical function in adults aged 50 years or older were analyzed, involving 384 participants. Results showed that HMB supplementation in addition to physical exercise has no or fairly low impact in improving body composition, muscle strength, or physical performance in adults aged 50 to 80 years, compared to exercise alone. There is a gap of knowledge on the beneficial effects of HMB combined with exercise to preserve cognitive functions in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Future RCTs are needed to refine treatment choices combining HMB and exercises for older people in particular populations, ages, and health status. Specifically, interventions in older adults aged 80 years or older, with cognitive impairment, frailty, or limited mobility are required.",

          "content": "The aim of this study was to verify the effect of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation on physical capacity, body composition and the value of biochemical parameters in highly-trained combat sports athletes. Forty-two males highly-trained in combat sports were subjected to 12 weeks of supplementation with HMB and a placebo in a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind crossover manner. Over the course of the experiment, aerobic and anaerobic capacity was determined, while analyses were conducted on body composition and levels of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, testosterone, cortisol and lactate. Following HMB supplementation, fat-free mass increased ( = 0.049) with a simultaneous reduction of fat mass ( = 0.016) in comparison to placebo. In turn, after HMB supplementation, the following indicators increased significantly in comparison to the placebo: the time to reach ventilatory threshold ( < 0.0001), threshold load ( = 0.017) and the threshold HR ( < 0.0001), as well as anaerobic peak power ( = 0.005), average power ( = 0.029), maximum speed ( < 0.001) and post-exercise lactate concentrations ( < 0.0001).

Baseline data, body composition, grip strength, Barthel index (BI), Harris hip score (HHS), and visual analog scale score (VAS) were compared among the four groups before and 3\u2009months after surgery. A total of 177 participants completed the trial, including 43 in the HMB\u2009+\u2009RT group, 44 in the HMB group, 45 in the RT group, and 45 in the negative control group. At the 3-month follow-up, the body composition and grip strength of the HMB\u2009+\u2009RT group and RT group were significantly improved compared with those before operation. The HMB group had no significant change, while the measures in the negative control group significantly decreased. Postoperative BI and HSS did not reach pre-injury levels in any of the four groups, but postoperative VAS score was significantly improved. However, there was no significant difference in BI, HSS, or VAS among the four groups. RT, with or without HMB supplementation, can effectively improve body composition and grip strength in elderly patients with sarcopenia after hip replacement at short-term follow-up. Simultaneously, use of exclusive HMB supplementation alone may also help to prevent decreases in muscle mass and grip strength in these patients.",

          "content": "Creatine monohydrate (CrM) and \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) are common ergogenic aids in the field of sports and are frequently used in an isolated way. However, there are a few studies that have investigated the effect of combining both supplements on different variables related to performance, with controversial results. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and the degree of potentiation of 10 weeks of CrM plus HMB supplementation on sports performance, which was measured by an incremental test to exhaustion in elite male traditional rowers. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 10-week study, participants ( = 28) were randomized to a placebo group (PLG;  = 7), CrM group (0.04 g/kg/day of CrM;  = 7), HMB group (3 g/day of HMB;  = 7) and CrM-HMB group (0.04 g/kg/day of CrM plus 3 g/day of HMB;  = 7). Before and after 10 weeks of different treatments, an incremental test was performed on a rowing ergometer to calculate the power that each rower obtained at the anaerobic threshold (WAT), and at 4 mmol (W4) and 8 mmol (W8) of blood lactate concentration. There were no significant differences in WAT and W4 among groups or in body composition. However, it was observed that the aerobic power achieved at W8 was significantly higher in the CrM-HMB group than in the PLG, CrM and HMB groups ( < 0.001; \u03b72 = 0.766). Likewise, a synergistic effect of combined supplementation was found for the sum of the two supplements separately at WAT (CrM-HMBG = 403.19% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 337.52%), W4 (CrM-HMBG = 2736.17% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 1705.32%) and W8 (CrM-HMBG = 1293.4% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 877.56%). In summary, CrM plus HMB supplementation over 10 weeks showed a synergistic effect on aerobic power (measured as WAT, W4, and W8) during an incremental test but had no influence muscle mass.",

          "content": "Although beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine (Arg), and glutamine (Gln) may contribute to wound healing, no prospective studies have investigated the efficacy of a compound consisting of HMB, Arg, and Gln (HMB/Arg/Gln) for reducing wound complications following open abdominal surgery. This study evaluates the usefulness of perioperative nutrition using HMB/Arg/Gln in patients who were scheduled to undergo open surgery for abdominal malignancies in a randomized controlled trial. Patients scheduled for open surgery for abdominal malignancies were randomized to receive HMB/Arg/Gln (1.2 g HMB, 7 g L-Arg, and 7 g L-Gln) or placebo (isocaloric juice). The supplements were provided once daily for 3 days preoperatively and once daily for 7 days postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the incidence of wound complications. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of other complications, postoperative duration of hospital stay, total-body skeletal muscle mass, handgrip strength, and skin water content. Sixty-one patients were randomly assigned to either the HMB/Arg/Gln (n = 31) or the placebo (n = 30) group. One patient in the HMB/Arg/Gln group was ineligible because laparoscopic surgery was performed; thus, 60 patients were analyzed. The incidence of wound complications (20%) was the same in both groups (P = 1.000). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other complications, body composition, handgrip strength, or skin water content between the 2 groups. Serum growth hormone (GH) levels were significantly higher for patients whose total intake was > 80% of planned volume in the HMB/Arg/Gln group. The incidence of wound complications would not be reduced by perioperative HMB/Arg/Gln administration in patients who underwent open surgery. The efficacy of HMB/Arg/Gln for increasing serum GH levels needs to be validated in another large-scale randomized controlled trial.",

Outcomes investigated were: total body mass (TBM), FFM, fat mass (FM), total single repetition maximum (1RM), bench press (BP) 1RM, and lower body (LwB) 1RM. Databases consulted were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (Embase), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SportDiscus. Fourteen studies fit the inclusion criteria; however, 11 were analyzed after data extraction and funnel plot analysis exclusion. A total of 302 participants (18-45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 248 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes. We conclude that HMB produces a small effect on TBM gain, but this effect does not translate into significantly greater increases in FFM, strength or decreases in FM during periods of RET. Our findings do not support the use of HMB aiming at improvement of body composition or strength with RET.",

          "content": "Frailty is a key element in healthy ageing in which muscle performance plays a main role. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation has shown favourable effects in modulating protein synthesis, improving muscle mass and function in interventional studies. Decreased age-related endogenous HMB levels have been shown in previous studies. The aim of the present study is to assess whether there is an association between endogenous plasma HMB levels and frailty. Data from 1290 subjects (56.98% women; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation age 74.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.95\u00a0years) from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging were obtained. Participants had their frailty status qualified according to Fried's Frailty Phenotype (FFP) score and the Frailty Trait Scale in its 12-domain version (FTS-12). Plasma HMB levels were analysed by an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Differences between groups (frail vs. non-frail) were tested using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-squared test. The association between HMB and frailty was assessed by multivariate linear and logistic regressions when frailty was analysed as continuous and binary, respectively. Models were adjusted by age, gender, comorbidity, body composition and protein intake. HMB levels were lower in those aged \u226575\u00a0years than in those aged 65-74\u00a0years, with an inverse linear relationship between age and HMB levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.031; P\u00a0=\u00a00.018), mainly accounted by males (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.062; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). HMB levels were higher in men (0.238\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.065 vs. 0.193\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.051\u00a0ng/mL; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). HMB levels were significantly lower in frail than in non-frail individuals: 0.204\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.058 versus 0.217\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.063\u00a0ng/dL (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) according to the FFP and 0.203\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.059 versus 0.219\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.063\u00a0ng/mL (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) according to FTS-12. These differences showed a dose-dependent profile when we compared them by quintiles of HMB (P for trend: 0.022; 0.012 and 0.0004, respectively, for FFP, FTS-12 binary and FTS-12 continuous). Variables associated with low HMB levels were body mass index, strength, exhaustion and weight loss. Frailty was associated with HMB levels in all the adjusted models, including the fully adjusted ones, no matter the tool used (odds ratio: 0.45 [0.26, 0.77] for FFP and 0.36 [0.20, 0.63] for FTS-12 binary; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-4.76 [-7.29, -2.23] for FTS-12 score). This association was also observed when the analyses were done by quintiles, showing such association since Q4 (FFP), Q2 (FTS-12 binary) and Q3 (FTS-12 score). The associations were observed in the whole sample and in each gender. There is an inverse association between HMB levels and frailty status. These findings support the design of targeted clinical trials to evaluate the effect of HMB supplementation in older frail people with low HMB levels.",

In this prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we studied the effect of HMB (3 g/day) supplementation on body composition, muscle strength, anaerobic and aerobic capacity, anabolic/catabolic hormones and inflammatory mediators in elite, national team level adolescent volleyball players (13.5-18 years, 14 males, 14 females, Tanner stage 4-5) during the first 7 weeks of the training season. HMB led to a significant greater increase in FFM by skinfold thickness (56.4 \u00b1 10.2 to 56.3 \u00b1 8.6 vs. 59.3 \u00b1 11.3 to 61.6 \u00b1 11.3 kg in the control and HMB group, respectively, p < 0.001). HMB led to a significant greater increase in both dominant and non-dominant knee flexion isokinetic force/FFM, measured at fast (180\u00b0/sec) and slow (60\u00b0/sec) angle speeds, but had no significant effect on knee extension and elbow flexion and extension. HMB led to a significant greater increase in peak and mean anaerobic power determined by the Wingate anaerobic test (peak power: 15.5 \u00b1 1.6 to 16.2 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 15.4 \u00b1 1.6 to 17.2 \u00b1 1.2 watts/FFM, mean power: 10.6 \u00b1 0.9 to 10.8 \u00b1 1.1 vs. 10.7 \u00b1 0.8 to 11.8 \u00b1 1.0 watts/FFM in control and HMB group, respectively, p < 0.01), with no effect on fatigue index. HMB had no significant effect on aerobic fitness or on anabolic (growth hormone, IGF-I, testosterone), catabolic (cortisol) and inflammatory mediators (IL-6 and IL-1 receptor antagonist). HMB supplementation was associated with greater increases in muscle mass, muscle strength and anaerobic properties with no effect on aerobic capacity suggesting some advantage for its use in elite adolescent volleyball players during the initial phases of the training season. These effects were not accompanied by hormonal and inflammatory mediator changes.",

In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 male cyclists ingested a leucine/protein/CHO/fat supplement (LEUPRO 7.5/20/89/22 g \u00b7 h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric CHO/fat control (119/22 g \u00b7 h(-1)) 1-3 h after exercise during a 6-d training block (intense intervals, recovery, repeated-sprint performance rides). Daily protein intake was clamped at 1.9 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (LEUPRO) and 1.5 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (control). Stable isotope infusions (1-(13)C-leucine and 6,6-(2)H2-glucose), mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and nitrogen balance methods were used to determine the effects of LEUPRO on whole-body branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and glucose metabolism and protein turnover. After exercise, LEUPRO increased BCAA levels in plasma (2.6-fold; 90% confidence limits = \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and urine (2.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.2) and increased products of BCAA metabolism plasma acylcarnitine C5 (3.0-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 0.9) and urinary leucine (3.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.3) and \u03b2-aminoisobutyrate (3.4-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.4), indicating that ingesting ~10 g leucine per hour during recovery exceeds the capacity to metabolize BCAA. Furthermore, LEUPRO increased leucine oxidation (5.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and nonoxidative disposal (4.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and left leucine balance positive relative to control. With the exception of day 1 (LEUPRO = 17 \u00b1 20 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = -90 \u00b1 44 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)), subsequent (days 2-5) nitrogen balance was positive for both conditions (LEUPRO = 130 \u00b1 110 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = 111 \u00b1 86 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)). Compared with control feeding, LEUPRO lowered the serum creatine kinase concentration by 21%-25% (90% confidence limits = \u00b1 14%), but the effect on sprint power was trivial (day 4 = 0.4% \u00b1 1.0%, day 6 = -0.3% \u00b1 1.0%). Postexercise protein-leucine supplementation saturates BCAA metabolism and attenuates tissue damage, but effects on subsequent intense endurance performance may be inconsequential under conditions of positive daily nitrogen balance.",

Therefore, a 24-week, prospective randomized open blinded-endpoint trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplementation of 8 g of BCAA or 7.5 g of soy protein on skeletal muscle and glycemic control as well as adverse events in elderly individuals with T2D. Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to the BCAA group ( = 21) and the soy protein group ( = 15). Skeletal muscle mass and HbA1c, which were primary endpoints, did not change over time or differ between groups. However, knee extension muscle strength was significantly increased in the soy protein group and showed a tendency to increase in the BCAA group. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance did not significantly change during the trial. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved in the BCAA group but the difference between groups was not significant. Results suggested that BCAA supplementation may not affect skeletal muscle mass and glycemic control and may improve depressive symptoms in elderly individuals with T2D.",

We sought to identify biomarkers predictive of type 2 diabetes remission and amount of weight loss in individuals with severe obesity enrolled in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) and the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) studies. Targeted mass spectrometry-based profiling of 135 metabolites was performed in pre-intervention blood samples using a nested design for diabetes remission over five years (n\u2009=\u200993 LABS, n\u2009=\u200980 Look AHEAD; n\u2009=\u200987 remitters), and for extremes of weight loss at five years (n\u2009=\u2009151 LABS; n\u2009=\u200975 with high weight loss). Principal components analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, with PCA-derived metabolite factors tested for association with both diabetes remission and weight loss. Metabolic markers were tested for incremental improvement to clinical models, including the DiaRem score. Two metabolite factors were associated with diabetes remission: one primarily composed of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and tyrosine (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) [OR (95% CI)]\u2009=\u20091.4 [1.0-1.9], p\u2009=\u20090.045), and one with betaine and choline (OR [95% CI]\u2009=\u20090.7 [0.5-0.9], p\u2009=\u20090.02).These results were not significant after adjustment for multiple tests. Inclusion of these two factors in clinical models yielded modest improvements in model fit and performance: in a constructed clinical model, the C-statistic improved from 0.87 to 0.90 (p\u2009=\u20090.02), while the net reclassification index showed improvement in prediction compared to the DiaRem score (NRI\u2009=\u20090.26, p\u2009=\u20090.0013). No metabolite factors associated with weight loss at five years. Baseline levels of metabolites in the BCAA and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)-microbiome-related pathways are independently and incrementally associated with sustained diabetes remission after weight loss interventions in individuals with severe obesity. These metabolites could serve as clinically useful biomarkers to identify individuals who will benefit the most from weight loss interventions.",

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of 16 weeks branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) supplementation on frailty in frail compensated cirrhotic patients. After a 4-week run-in period consisted of dietary and exercise counseling, compensated cirrhotic patients with frailty, defined by liver frailty index (LFI)\u22654.5, were randomly assigned (1:1) to BCAA or control group. The BCAA group received twice daily BCAAs supplementation (210\u00a0kcal, protein 13.5\u00a0g, BCAA 2.03\u00a0g) for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was frailty reversion. The secondary outcomes were changes in biochemistries, body composition evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and quality of life (QoL). 54 patients were prospectively enrolled (age 65.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.9 years, 51.9% female, Child-Pugh A/B 68.5%/31.5%, MELD 10.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1).

          "content": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), comprising leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val), are essential nutrients vital for protein synthesis and metabolic regulation via specialized signaling networks. Their association with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has become a focal point of scientific debate, with emerging evidence suggesting both beneficial and detrimental roles. This review aims to dissect the multifaceted relationship between BCAAs and cardiovascular health, exploring the molecular mechanisms and clinical implications. Elevated BCAA levels have also been linked to insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), inflammation, and dyslipidemia, which are well-established risk factors for CVD. Central to these processes are key pathways such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activate B cells (NF-\u03baB)-mediated inflammation, and oxidative stress. Additionally, the interplay between BCAA metabolism and gut microbiota, particularly the production of metabolites like trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), adds another layer of complexity. Contrarily, some studies propose that BCAAs may have cardioprotective effects under certain conditions, contributing to muscle maintenance and metabolic health. This review critically evaluates the evidence, addressing the biological basis and signal transduction mechanism, and also discusses the potential for BCAAs to act as biomarkers versus active mediators of cardiovascular pathology. By presenting a balanced analysis, this review seeks to clarify the contentious roles of BCAAs in CVD, providing a foundation for future research and therapeutic strategies required because of the rising prevalence, incidence, and total burden of CVDs.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of BCAA supplementation on sarcopenia measures in patients with cirrhosis. We conducted a 12-month double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial of BCAA supplementation (30\u2009g daily) compared to an equicaloric, equi-nitrogenous whey protein in volunteers with cirrhosis and reduced muscle strength.

          "content": "Leucine is regarded as an anabolic trigger for the mTORC1 pathway and the stimulation muscle protein synthesis rates. More recently, there has been an interest in underpinning the relevance of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-containing dipeptides and their intact absorption into circulation to regulate muscle anabolic responses. We investigated the effects of dileucine and leucine ingestion on postprandial muscle protein turnover. Ten healthy young men (age: 23\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009yr) consumed either 2\u2009g of leucine (LEU) or 2\u2009g of dileucine (DILEU) in a randomized crossover design. The participants underwent repeated blood and muscle biopsy sampling during primed continuous infusions of l-[-C]phenylalanine and l-[N]phenylalanine to determine myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) and mixed muscle protein breakdown rates (MPB), respectively. LEU and DILEU similarly increased plasma leucine net area under the curve (AUC;  = 0.396). DILEU increased plasma dileucine AUC to a greater extent than LEU ( = 0.013). Phosphorylation of Akt ( = 0.002), rpS6 ( < 0.001), and p70S6K ( < 0.001) increased over time under both LEU and DILEU conditions. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 ( = 0.229) and eEF2 ( = 0.999) did not change over time irrespective of condition. Cumulative (0-180\u2009min) MPS increased in DILEU (0.075\u2009\u00b1\u20090.032%\u00b7h), but not in LEU (0.047\u2009\u00b1\u20090.029%\u00b7h;  = 0.023). MPB did not differ between LEU (0.043\u2009\u00b1\u20090.030%\u00b7h) and DILEU conditions (0.051\u2009\u00b1\u20090.027%\u00b7h;  = 0.659). Our results showed that dileucine ingestion elevated plasma dileucine concentrations and muscle protein turnover by stimulating MPS in young men. The role of dipeptides as anabolic agents remains unresolved in humans. We show that the ingestion of 2\u2009g dileucine increased plasma dileucine concentrations and resulted in an enhancement of muscle protein turnover by stimulating an increase in muscle protein synthesis rates in healthy young males.

          "content": "Fat-free mass (FFM) adaptations to physical training may differ between sexes based on disparities in fitness level, dietary intake, and levels of plasma amino acids (AA). This investigation aimed to determine FFM and plasma AA responses to military training, examine whether adaptations differ between male and female recruits, and explore potential associations between FFM and AA responses to training. Body composition and plasma AA levels were assessed in US Army recruits (n = 209, 118 males, 91 females) before (baseline) and every three weeks during basic combat training (BCT), a 10-week military training course. Body weight decreased in men but remained stable in women during BCT (sex-by-time interaction, P < 0.05). Fifty-eight percent of recruits gained FFM during BCT, with more (P < 0.05) females (88%) gaining FFM than males (36%). Total plasma AA increased (P < 0.05) during BCT, with greater (P < 0.05) increases observed in females (17%) then in males (4%). Essential amino acids (EAA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) were increased (P < 0.05) in females but did not change in males (sex-by-time interaction, P < 0.05). Independent of sex, changes in EAA (r = 0.34) and BCAA (r = 0.27) from baseline were associated with changes in FFM (P < 0.05); greater (P < 0.05) increases in AA concentrations were observed for those who gained FFM. Increases in FFM and plasma AA suggest that BCT elicits a more pronounced anabolic response in women compared to men, which may reflect sex-specific differences in the relative intensity of the combined training and physiological stimulus associated with BCT.",

          "title": "The Influence of Competition Day Loads on the Metabolic and Immune Response of Olympic Female Beach Volleyball Athletes: A Sportomics Analysis.",
          "content": "Beach volleyball (BVb) is a highly demanding Olympic sport characterized by intense physical activity and unique environmental challenges, including varying weather conditions and sandy, unstable court surfaces. Despite its popularity, there is a notable lack of scientific research addressing the metabolic and immune responses of elite female athletes in this sport. This study aims to address this gap by investigating two world-class Olympic medalists, female BVb players, who represent a country with a rich history in the sport.  Two athletes underwent a simulated competition day consisting of two matches. A standardized protocol was utilized to collect blood and urine samples at seven time points, allowing for analysis throughout the competition and recovery phases. The analysis included various electrolytes, as well as hematological, metabolic, and inflammatory markers. Additionally, we assessed selected hormones, such as insulin, serotonin, ACTH, and cortisol, along with amino acids related to energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis.  Both athletes presented a trend toward electrolyte disturbances, especially hypokalemia, with a mean decrease of 15% and individual values reaching as low as 3.3 mmol/L post-match. This indicates that BVb may pose a risk for such disturbances. Additionally, the matches led to 20% to 60% increases in muscle injury markers, with incomplete recovery even after a day of rest, signaling persistent physiological stress post-competition. This increase was matched by stimulating stress hormones (ACTH and cortisol rose up to 4-fold and 3-fold, respectively), and markers of exercise intensity, such as lactate and ammonium. Moreover, the simulated BVb competition day impacted the amino acid response, with the Fischer ratio (BCAA/AAA) and blood tryptophan decreasing to a minimum of 60% of the initial levels and blood serotonin increasing by up to 180%, which are signs of an increased risk of central fatigue onset, according to the Fischer and Newsholme theory.  The responses examined in this exploratory study contribute to a deeper understanding of the metabolic and immune demands placed on elite female BVb players, suggesting practical applications. By addressing the similar physiological responses observed among the athletes and emphasizing their unique individual responses-despite following the same protocol under identical conditions and sharing similar life habits for an extended period-this study highlights the critical necessity for the n-of-1 monitoring of athletes.",

          "content": "The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing rapidly, especially in low- and middle-income countries and has a high number of associated comorbidities. Plasmatic concentrations of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) have been shown to be elevated in T2D subjects in cross-sectional studies. However, the effect of lifestyle community-based interventions on BCAA and RBP4 concentrations has not yet been analyzed. The Feel4Diabetes study is a school and community-based intervention that identified 360 European families with a high risk of developing T2D according to the FINDRISC questionnaire. Families were randomized in control and intervention groups were followed-up from 2016 to 2018. In the Spanish families, the concentration of BCAA and RBP4 was determined in 266 subjects (115 control and 151 intervention group) that attended the three time-point assessments by colorimetric and ELISA reaction, respectively. Baseline BCAA levels showed positive correlations with the FINDRISC score and glucose impairment (baseline glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin), body mass index, and body weight. The participants receiving the community-based intervention showed a significant decrease in glycated hemoglobin and BCAA levels compared to the control group ( = 0.011 and  < 0.001, respectively). However, baseline RBP4 did not show significant correlations with anthropometric and glycemic parameters, and no significant change was observed in anthropometric parameters and RBP4 concentrations throughout the follow-up. A community-based intervention on lifestyle led to a significant reduction in BCAA levels regardless of weight loss. These findings suggest that this interventional approach could be promising in T2D prevention.",

          "title": "Adding Branched-Chain Amino Acids and Vitamin D to Whey Protein Is More Effective than Protein Alone in Preserving Fat Free Mass and Muscle Strength in the First Month after Sleeve Gastrectomy.",
          "content": "Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is one of the most commonly performed weight loss (WL) bariatric procedures. The main goal of WL is reducing total body weight (TBW) and fat mass (FM). However, TBW loss is systematically accompanied by a decline in fat-free mass (FFM), predominantly in the first post-surgical month, despite protein supplementation. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and vitamin D seem to attenuate loss of FFM and, thus, reduce the decline in muscle strength (MS). However, data on the role of an integrated supplementation with whey protein plus BCAAs plus vitamin D (P+BCAAs+Vit.D) vs. protein alone on total weight loss (TWL), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and (MS) in the first month after SG are lacking. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the impact of P+BCAAs+Vit.D vs. protein alone supplementation on TWL, FM, FFM, and MS in the first month after SG. Before SG and at 1 month afterward, we prospectively measured and compared TBW, FM, FFM, and MS in 57 patients who received either a supplementation with P+BCAAs+Vit.D (n = 31) or protein alone (n = 26). The impact of P+BCAAs+Vit.D and protein alone supplementation on clinical status was also evaluated. Despite non-significant variation in TBW, FM decreased more significantly (18.5% vs. 13.2%,  = 0.023) with the P+BCAA+Vit.D supplementation compared to protein alone. Furthermore, the P+BCAA+Vit.D group showed a significantly lower decrease in FFM (4.1% vs. 11.4%,  < 0.001) and MS (3.8% vs. 18.5%,  < 0.001) compared to the protein alone group. No significant alterations in clinical status were seen in either group. P+BCAA+Vit.D supplementation is more effective than protein alone in determining FM loss and is associated with a lower decrease in FFM and MS, without interfering with clinical status in patients 1 month after SG.",

In addition to the differences in microbiome, the role of the microbiome in the gut is also important to be clarified because it has recently been shown that the microbiome may produce branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in the body. In this single-center study, sixty-nine CLD patients were divided by skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) into low (L-SMI: n\u2009=\u200925) and normal (N-SMI: n\u2009=\u200944). Microbiome was analyzed from stool samples based on V3-4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA). L-SMI had a lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio than N-SMI. At the genus level, Coprobacillus, Catenibacterium and Clostridium were also lower while the Bacteroides was higher. Predictive functional profiling of the L-SMI group showed that genes related to nitrogen metabolism were enriched, but those related to amino acid metabolism, including BCAA biosynthesis, were lower. The genes related to 'LPS biosynthesis' was also higher. The microbiome of CLD patients with low muscle mass is characterized not only by high relative abundance of gram-negative bacteria with LPS, but also by the possibility of low potential for amino acid synthesis including BCAAs.",

Blood ketones were elevated (p < .001) after ingestion of both KCT (0.65 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0mmol/L) and KT (0.72 \u00b1 0.31\u00a0mmol/L) relative to CHO-PLAC (0.06 \u00b1 0.05\u00a0mmol/L). Moreover, KCT improved (p < .003) 20-km cycling time-trial performance (37.80 \u00b1 2.28\u00a0min), compared with CHO-PLAC (39.40 \u00b1 3.33\u00a0min) but not versus KT (38.75 \u00b1 2.87\u00a0min; p < .09). 20-km cycling time-trial average power output was greater with KCT (power output = 180.5 \u00b1 28.7\u00a0W) versus both KT (170.9 \u00b1 31.7\u00a0W; p = .049) and CHO-PLAC (164.8 \u00b1 34.7\u00a0W; p = .001). Wingate peak power output was also greater for both KCT (1,134 \u00b1 137\u00a0W; p = .031) and KT (1,132 \u00b1 128\u00a0W; p = .039) versus CHO-PLAC (1,068 \u00b1 127\u00a0W). These data suggest that the observed improved exercise performance effects of this multi-ingredient supplement containing beta-hydroxybutyrate salts, taurine, and leucine are attributed partially to the addition of caffeine.",

          "content": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between abdominal obesity and dietary taurine intake, nutrient intake, anthropometric data and body composition in Korean male college students. One hundred seventy four subjects were divided into 2 groups based on abdominal obesity as estimated by waist circumference (cm) (Lee et al. 2006): normal group (waist circumference (cm): < 90 cm, n = 141), obese group (waist circumference (cm): > or = 90 cm, n = 33). A three day-recall method was used to assess diet (2 weekdays and 1 weekend). Anthropometric data and body composition were measured with Inbody 3.0 (Bioelectrical Impedance Fatness Analyzer). Average dietary intake of taurine in the normal and obese groups was 123.1 +/- 78.8 mg/day and 128.4 +/- 79.6 mg/day, respectively. There was no significant difference in dietary taurine and nutrient intake between the normal and obese groups. However, data of anthropometric measurements and body composition in the obese group were significantly elevated compared to those of the normal group. In the normal group, dietary taurine intake was positively correlated with nutrient intake (p < 0.01), the exception being the intake of plant lipid and of animal calcium. In the obese group, dietary taurine intake was positively correlated with the intake of energy foods and of animal lipid (p < 0.05). There were positive correlations between dietary taurine intake, weight and hip circumference (p < 0.05) in the normal group. However, there was no significant correlation between dietary taurine intake and anthropometric and body composition data in the obese group. Therefore, the data suggest that further study is warranted to examine the relationship between dietary taurine intake and abdominal obesity.",

          "content": "We aimed to investigate the effects of an 8-week total-body resistance exercise (TRX) suspension training intervention combined with taurine supplementation on body composition, blood glucose, and lipid markers in T2D females. Forty T2D middle-aged females (age: 53 \u00b1 5 years, body mass = 84.3 \u00b1 5.1 kg) were randomly assigned to four groups, TRX suspension training + placebo (TP;  = 10), TRX suspension training + taurine supplementation (TT;  = 10), taurine supplementation (T;  = 10), or control (C;  = 10). Body composition (body mass, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BFP)), blood glucose (fasting blood sugar (FBS)), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), Insulin, and Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and lipid markers (low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC)) were evaluated prior to and after interventions. All three interventions significantly decreased body mass, BMI, and BFP with no changes between them for body mass and BMI; however, BFP changes in the TT group were significantly greater than all other groups. FBS was significantly reduced in TP and TT. Insulin concentrations' decrement were significantly greater in all experimental groups compared to C; however, no between group differences were observed between TT, TP, and T. In regards to HOMA-IR, decreases in TT were significantly greater than all other groups TG, HbA1c, and LDL were reduced following all interventions. HDL values significantly increased only in the TT group, while TC significantly decreased in TP and TT groups. Changes in HbA1c, TG, HDL, and TC were significantly greater in the TT compared to all other groups. TRX training improved glycemic and lipid profiles, while taurine supplementation alone failed to show hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties. Notably, the synergic effects of TRX training and taurine supplementation were shown in HbA1c, HOMA-IR, TG, TC, HDL, and BFP changes. Our outcomes suggest that TRX training + taurine supplementation may be an effective adjuvant therapy in individuals with T2D.",

          "content": "We compared the metabolomic profile of aqueous humor from patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG; n = 26) with that of a group of age- and sex-matched non-POAG controls (n = 26), all participants undergoing cataract surgery. Supervised paired partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed good predictive performance for test sets with a median area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.89 and a p-value of 0.0087. Twenty-three metabolites allowed discrimination between the two groups. Univariate analysis after the Benjamini-Hochberg correction showed significant differences for 13 of these metabolites. The POAG metabolomic signature indicated reduced concentrations of taurine and spermine and increased concentrations of creatinine, carnitine, three short-chain acylcarnitines, 7 amino acids (glutamine, glycine, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, hydroxyl-proline, and acetyl-ornithine), 7 phosphatidylcholines, one lysophosphatidylcholine, and one sphingomyelin. This suggests an alteration of metabolites involved in osmoprotection (taurine and creatinine), neuroprotection (spermine, taurine, and carnitine), amino acid metabolism (7 amino acids and three acylcarnitines), and the remodeling of cell membranes drained by the aqueous humor (hydroxyproline and phospholipids). Five of these metabolic alterations, already reported in POAG plasma, concern spermine, C3 and C4 acylcarnitines, PC aa 34:2, and PC aa 36:4, thus highlighting their importance in the pathogenesis of glaucoma.",

A double-blind, acute, and crossover study design was conducted. Seventeen men (age 24.8 \u00b1 4.07y; BMI: 23.9 \u00b1 2.57 kg/m\u00b2) participated in the present study. Different doses of taurine (TAU) (3 g or 6 g) or placebo were supplemented 90 minutes before a single bout of fasting aerobic exercise (on a treadmill at 60% of VO2 max). The subjects performed three trials, and each one was separated by seven days. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after the exercise protocol of each test to analyze plasma levels of glycerol and taurine. Lipid and carbohydrate oxidation were determined immediately after exercise for 15 minutes by indirect calorimetry. We observed that TAU supplementation (6 g) increased lipid oxidation (38%) and reduced the respiratory coefficient (4%) when compared to the placebo ( < 0.05). However, no differences in lipid oxidation were observed between the different doses of taurine (3 g and 6 g). For glycerol concentrations, there were no differences between trials. Six grams of TAU supplementation 90 minutes before a single bout of aerobic exercise in a fasted state was sufficient to increase the lipid oxidation post-exercise in healthy young men.",

We investigated the physiological effects of Bigu-style fasting and underlying metabolic reprogramming in healthy adults. We conducted a 5-d Bigu trial in 43 healthy subjects [age 23.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4 y; BMI (in kg/m2) 22.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.79]. Physiological indicators and body composition were monitored daily during fasting day 1 (F1D) to F5D and after 10-d refeeding postfasting (R10D) and R30D. Blood samples were collected in the morning. Risk factors associated with inflammation, aging, cardiovascular diseases, malnutrition, and organ dysfunction were evaluated by biochemical measurements. Untargeted plasma metabolomics and gut microbial profiling were performed using plasma and fecal samples. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction. Correlation analyses for metabolite modules and taurine were analyzed by Spearman's rank and Pearson tests, respectively. Heart rate was accelerated throughout the fasting period. Risk factors associated with inflammation and cardiovascular diseases were significantly lowered during or after Bigu (P <\u00a00.05). Body composition measurement detected an overconsumption of fat starting from F3D till 1 mo after refeeding. Metabolomics unveiled a coupling between gluconeogenesis and cholesterol biosynthesis beyond F3D. Plasma taurine significantly increased at F3D by 31%-46% followed by a reduction to basal level at F5D (P <\u00a00.001), a pattern inversely correlated with changes in glucose and de novo synthesized cholesterol (r = -0.407 and -0.296, respectively; P <\u00a00.001). Gut microbial profiling showed an enrichment of taurine-utilizing bacteria at F5D, which was completely recovered at R10D. Our data demonstrate that 5-d Bigu is potentially beneficial to health in young adults. A starvation threshold of 3-d fasting is necessary for maintaining glucose and cholesterol homeostasis via a taurine-microbiota regulatory loop. Our findings provide novel insights into the physiological and metabolic responses of the human body to continuous Bigu-style fasting.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two biologically active compounds: 2-aminoethane-sulfonic acid (taurine) and 3-hydroxy-4-trimethylaminobutyrate (L-carnitine) on urinary 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol/cortisol (6\u03b2-OHC/cortisol) metabolic ratio as a biomarker of the CYP3A4 activity of healthy volunteers. Taurine is used for the treatment of chronic heart failure and liver disease. Cardiologists, nephrologists, neurologists, gerontologists in addition to the main etiopathogenetic therapies, use L-carnitine. The quantification of the 6\u03b2-OHC/cortisol metabolic ratio as a biomarker of CYP3A4 activity in human urine was used for the assessment of CYP3A4 catalytic activity as a non-invasive test. Methods The study included 18 healthy male volunteers (aged from 18 to 35 years old). The volunteers took taurine in a dose of 500 mg twice a day or L-carnitine in a dose of 2.5 mL 3 times a day for 14 consecutive days. The test drug was given 20 min before meals. The collection of urine samples was performed before and after 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after taurine intake. The metabolic ratio of 6\u03b2-OHC/cortisol in morning spot urine samples was studied by the liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) method. Results The ratio of 6-6\u03b2-OHC/cortisol was used as a biomarker to study the taurine and L-carnitine influence on CYP3A4 metabolism of cortisol. The ratio of urinary 6\u03b2-OCH/cortisol in the morning urine samples of volunteers before the beginning of taurine therapy (baseline ratio) was 2.71 \u00b1 0.2. Seven days after the administration of taurine in a dose of 500 mg twice a day, the 6\u03b2-OCH/cortisol ratio was 3.3 \u00b1 0.2, which indicated the increased catalytic activity of CYP3A4 towards cortisol. As for the L-carnitine supplementation, analysis of the 6\u03b2-OCH/cortisol ratio in the urine for 14 days did not show any significant changes in this baseline ratio, indicating the lack of L-carnitine influence on the catalytic activity of CYP3A4 to cortisol. Conclusions The results obtained demonstrated the influence of taurine on 6\u03b2-OCH/cortisol metabolic ratio as a biomarker of CYP3A4 catalytic activity to cortisol. L-carnitine did not affect the activity of CYP3A4. The lack of a clinically meaningful effect of L-carnitine was established.",

Taurine deficiency, which is common in CF, may contribute to the increased breakdown. The occurrence of and the benefit of taurine supplementation to abnormal protein metabolism in apparently optimally treated CF were assessed using a 12-mo double-blind crossover technique in 14 well-nourished and seven mildly-moderately malnourished infection-free preadolescent CF children. Muscle protein breakdown (urinary 3-methylhistidine technique) was significantly decreased in well-nourished (1.35% degraded/24 h +/- 0.15, p less than 0.05) and malnourished (1.24 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.001) CF children compared with controls (1.50 +/- 0.17, n = 13). Whole-body protein flux, synthesis, and catabolism ([15N]-glycine technique) were similar in all groups. Net protein gain was greater in CF children, particularly those who were well-nourished (0.55 g/(kg X 10 h) +/- 0.35, p less than 0.01) compared with controls (0.16 +/- 0.26). Taurine supplementation did not significantly affect any of the indices. In the absence of infection, protein metabolism in CF children responds appropriately to malnutrition.",

We hypothesized that taurine supplementation associated with high-intensity exercise could increase levels of lipolysis, benefiting swimmer performance. Nine male competitive swimmers performed two 400-m front crawl maximal efforts with a 1-week washout, and the athletes received 6 g of taurine (TAU) or placebo (PLA) supplementation 120\u00a0min before performing the effort. Oxygen consumption and the contribution of the energy systems were analyzed post effort using a Quark CPET gas analyzer. Blood samples were collected before, and 5\u00a0min post the effort for taurine and glycerol analysis. Immediately before and 3, 5, and 7\u00a0min post the effort, blood samples from the earlobe were collected to determine lactate levels. An increase of 159% was observed in taurine plasma levels 120\u00a0min post ingestion. Glycerol levels were higher in both groups post effort; however, the TAU condition promoted an 8% higher increase than the PLA. No changes were observed in swimmer performance or lactate levels; however, the percentage change in lactate levels (\u2206[La]) was different (TAU: 9.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.78\u00a0mmol\u00a0L; PLA: 11.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.19\u00a0mmol\u00a0L, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Acute taurine supplementation 120\u00a0min before performing a maximal effort did not improve swimmer performance; however, it increased glycerol plasma levels and reduced both the \u2206[La] and lactic anaerobic system contribution.",

          "content": "This study examined 1) the plasma taurine response to acute oral taurine supplementation (T), and 2) the effects of 7 days of T on muscle amino acid content and substrate metabolism during 2 h of cycling at approximately 60% peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). In the first part of the study, after an overnight fast, 7 volunteers (28+/-3 yr, 184+/-2 cm, 88.0+/-6.6 kg) ingested 1.66 g oral taurine doses with breakfast (8 AM) and lunch (12 noon), and blood samples were taken throughout the day. In the second part of the study, eight men (22+/-1 yr, 181+/-1 cm, 80.9+/-3.8 kg, 4.21+/-0.16 l/min VO2peak) cycled for 2 h after 7 days of placebo (P) ingestion (6 g glucose/day) and again following 7 days of T (5 g/day). In the first part of the study, plasma taurine was 64+/-4 microM before T and rose rapidly to 778+/-139 microM by 10 AM and remained elevated at noon (359+/-56 microM). Plasma taurine reached 973+/-181 microM at 1 PM and was 161+/-31 microM at 4 PM. In the second part of the study, seven days of T had no effect on muscle taurine content (mmol/kg dry muscle) at rest (P, 44+/-15 vs. T, 42+/-15) or after exercise (P, 43+/-12 vs. T, 43+/-11). There was no difference in muscle glycogen or other muscle metabolites between conditions, but there were notable interaction effects for muscle valine, isoleucine, leucine, cystine, glutamate, alanine, and arginine amino acid content following exercise after T. These data indicate that 1) acute T produces a 13-fold increase in plasma taurine concentration; 2) despite the ability to significantly elevate plasma taurine for extended periods throughout the day, 7 days of T does not alter skeletal muscle taurine content or carbohydrate and fat oxidation during exercise; and 3) T appears to have some impact on muscle amino acid response to exercise.",

          "content": "Taurine is the most abundant amino acid in the human body and seems to play an important role in increasing glucose-mediated insulin secretion, as well as in programming beta-cell maturation during the prenatal life in utero. To test the hypothesis that plasma taurine is related to glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in subjects with history of beta-cell dysfunction such as women with history of gestational diabetes (GDM), we studied 72 non-diabetic women with history of GDM (n=43), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n=7), and normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n=22) as previously classified by a 100g-3h-OGTT performed between the 24th and the 28th gestational week. Insulin sensitivity (ISIogtt, calculated through Matsuda-DeFronzo index) and a proxy for insulin secretion (basal plasma C-peptide/fasting plasma glucose; CP/glucose) were measured during and after pregnancy. Plasma taurine was measured after a median period of 6 years (2-11 years) from index pregnancy, when glucose tolerance was retested by a 75 g-2h-OGTT. Plasma taurine was significantly lower in women who had experienced GDM and was unrelated to ISIogtt. Moreover, plasma taurine was inversely related to previous gestational area-under-curve of glucose and directly related to post-gestational CP/glucose, as well to CP/glucose measured during pregnancy (p<0.05 for both). The relative risk of altered glucose metabolism during previous pregnancies (IGT+GDM) was higher as plasma taurine decreased, even after adjusting for age, time-lag from pregnancy, body mass index and family history of diabetes (OR: 0.980; CI 95%: 0.963-0.999, p=0.003). In conclusion plasma taurine seems to be a fair marker of altered glucose metabolism during past pregnancies in women with antecedent GDM and appears to be inversely related to the previous as well as to the actual insulin secretion in these subjects.",

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a 24-week l-carnitine supplementation on serum inflammatory markers, IGF-1, body composition and skeletal muscle strength in healthy human subjects over 65 years of age. Women between 65 and 70 years of age were supplemented for 24 weeks with either 1500 mg l-carnitine-l-tartrate or an isonitrogenous placebo per day in a double-blind fashion. Before and after the supplementation protocol, body mass and composition, as well as knee extensor and flexor muscle strength were determined. In the blood samples, free carnitine, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, C-reactive protein and IGF-1 were determined. A marked increase in free plasma carnitine concentration was observed due to l-carnitine supplementation. No substantial changes in other parameters were noted. In the current study, supplementation for 24 weeks affected neither the skeletal muscle strength nor circulating markers in healthy women over 65 years of age. Positive and negative aspects of l-carnitine supplementation need to be clarified.",

          "content": "The purpose of this investigation was to describe the dynamics of carnitine metabolism during an acute episode of exercise. Twenty-eight subjects (14 male; 14 female) exercised for 40 min on a bicycle ergometer at 55% of their maximal aerobic capacities. Blood samples were obtained at rest, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min of exercise, and 15-min postexercise. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were performed before and after exercise. Results demonstrated that the percent of acylated plasma carnitine increased significantly (P less than 0.05) across all subjects from 17.3% at rest to 22.3% by 40 min of exercise and continued to increase to 22.8% 15-min postexercise. Total muscle carnitine levels fell significantly (P less than 0.001) across all subjects from 4.21 (1.27) (means +/- SD) mumol/g wet weight at rest to 3.29 (1.27) mumol/g wet weight after exercise. Well-trained males and females had almost identical levels of muscle carnitine [4.35(1.86) and 4.34 (0.64) mumol/g wet weight, respectively]. These levels were somewhat higher but not significantly higher than their moderately trained counterparts [3.86(1.34) and 4.28(1.18) males and females, respectively]. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase (E.C. 2.3.1.21) activity also declined significantly (P less than 0.05) across all subjects after exercise. This study is the first to demonstrate a potential loss of acylated carnitine forms from muscle to plasma during acute exercise, possibly reflecting an increase in carnitine turnover. Alterations in carnitine status may represent another metabolic adaptation to chronic exercise training.",

Although elevated circulating concentrations have been observed in obesity and insulin resistance, prospective studies examining whether these metabolites are associated with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are sparse. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of metabolites along the carnitine pathway relative to incident T2D. A total of 2519 patients (73.1% men) with coronary artery disease, but without T2D, were followed for median 7.7 years until the end of 2009, during which 173 (6.9%) new cases of T2D were identified. Serum levels of free carnitine, its precursors trimethyllysine (TML) and \u03b3-butyrobetaine, and the esters acetyl-, propionyl-, (iso)valeryl-, octanoyl-, and palmitoylcarnitine were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Risk associations were explored by logistic regression and reported per (log-transformed) standard deviation increment. Median age at inclusion was 62 years and median body mass index (BMI) 26.0 kg/m2. In models adjusted for age, sex, fasting status, BMI, estimated glomerular filtration rate, glycated hemoglobin A1c, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and study center, serum levels of TML and palmitoylcarnitine associated positively [odds ratio (95% confidence interval), 1.22 (1.04 to 1.43) and 1.24 (1.04 to 1.49), respectively], whereas \u03b3-butyrobetaine associated negatively [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.81 (0.66 to 0.98)] with T2D risk. Serum levels of TML, \u03b3-butyrobetaine, and the long-chained palmitoylcarnitine predict long-term risk of T2D independently of traditional risk factors, possibly reflecting dysfunctional fatty acid metabolism in patients susceptible to T2D development.",

Measurements were made on venous blood samples collected during each experiment at fixed time intervals over an initial rest of 45 min, 60 min bicycle exercise performed near 50% VO2max and 120 min recovery. Free and total plasma carnitine levels reached a plateau corresponding to an average rise of 25% for both fractions, 9-10 days after the beginning of the L-carn diet. These levels returned to their initial values 6-8 weeks after cessation of the supply. Generally L-carn supplementation did not significantly modify the physiological parameters and circulating metabolites. No distinct increase of the relative participation of endogenous lipids in the fuel supply of prolonged submaximal exercise was observed. In normal human subjects the increased demand for fatty acid oxidation resulting from exercise seems to be adequately supported by endogenous levels of carnitine.",

          "content": "Haemodialysis patients have impaired exercise tolerance that may be related to impaired carnitine availability and/or alterations in carnitine metabolism. As carnitine metabolism is sex- and age-related, we examined plasma free and esterified carnitine concentrations, muscle strength, and estimated exercise tolerance in female (n=51) and male (n=63) patients of different ages (18-86 years). Concentrations of free carnitine and acetylcarnitine were determined in the plasma of patients. Isometric handgrip strength was measured using a dynamometer while exercise tolerance was predicted from scores for self-reported walking distance on the level and on an incline. Plasma total carnitine concentration in the females was significantly lower than that of males (35.4+/-1.3 and 42.4+/-1.4 micro mol/l, respectively, P<0.01). This was almost entirely due to the lower plasma free carnitine concentration of females when compared with the males (20.6+/-0.9 and 26.3+/-1.1 micro mol/l, respectively, P<0.05). Furthermore, plasma free carnitine concentrations were negatively correlated with age in females (r=-0.45, P<0.001) even when the linear effects of haemoglobin, albumin, body weight, time on dialysis, and muscle strength were removed from the regression analysis (partial correlation coefficient; pcc=-0.43, P=0.018), but not in the males (r=0.03, P>0.05). Isometric handgrip strength and estimated exercise tolerance on the level were lower in females than males (138.9+/-10.9 and 259.0+/-15.2 N, P<0.001; and 3.5+/-0.2 and 4.3+/-0.2, P<0.05, respectively). Isometric handgrip strength and estimated exercise tolerance (walking distance on the level and on an incline) were positively correlated with plasma free carnitine concentrations in females, but not in the males. There was a strong relationship between plasma free carnitine concentrations and age in female patients, but not in males. It is unlikely that the reduction in plasma free carnitine in females was a direct causative factor in their reduced exercise tolerance, but probably reflects greater muscle de-conditioning/atrophy with age in female patients.",

          "content": "We examined 1) the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on free fatty acid (FFA) utilization during exercise and 2) exercise-induced alterations in plasma levels and skeletal muscle exchange of carnitine. Seven moderately trained human male subjects serving as their own controls participated in two bicycle exercise sessions (120 min, 50% of VO2max). The second exercise was preceded by 5 days of oral carnitine supplementation (CS; 5 g daily). Despite a doubling of plasma carnitine levels, with CS, there were no effects on exercise-induced changes in arterial levels and turnover of FFA, the relation between leg FFA inflow and FFA uptake, or the leg exchange of other substrates. Heart rate during exercise after CS decreased 7-8%, but O2 uptake was unchanged. Exercise before CS induced a fall from 33.4 +/- 1.6 to 30.8 +/- 1.0 (SE) mumol/l in free plasma carnitine despite a release (2.5 +/- 0.9 mumol/min) from the leg. Simultaneously, acylated plasma carnitine rose from 5.0 +/- 1.0 to 14.2 +/- 1.4 mumol/l, with no evidence of leg release. Consequently, total plasma carnitine increased. We concluded that in healthy subjects CS does not influence muscle substrate utilization either at rest or during prolonged exercise and that free carnitine released from muscle during exercise is presumably acylated in the liver and released to plasma.",

There is reduction in ischaemia showing reduced ST-segment depression and angina, greater effort tolerance and decreased need of cardiac drugs. Carnitine can cause overall improvement in cardiac performance in patients with CAD as well as in cardiomyopathy. More studies are necessary to demonstrate where carnitine can scavenge free radicals apart from its beneficial effect on fatty acid metabolism.

          "content": "The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose titration, multicenter trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of propionyl-carnitine in intermittent claudication. Human and animal studies indicate that propionyl-L-carnitine increases carnitine content and improves energy metabolism in the ischemic skeletal muscle. After a 2-week preliminary period to assess maximal walking distance, 245 patients were randomly assigned to receive propionyl-L-carnitine (n = 118) or placebo (n = 127). The initial oral dose of 500 mg twice daily was increased at 2-month intervals to 2 g/day and then to 3 g/day in patients showing improvement in treadmill performance < 30% over baseline. Efficacy analysis was conducted for the 214 patients who completed the 24 weeks of treatment by comparing the effect of placebo and propionyl-L-carnitine on day 180. Analysis of variance showed a significant improvement of 73 +/- 9% (mean +/- SE) in maximal walking distance with propionyl-L-carnitine (n = 99) compared with 46 +/- 6% for placebo (n = 115, p = 0.03). For distance walked at onset of claudication, propionyl-L-carnitine showed about double the improvement of placebo; however, the difference was not statistically significant. There were no changes in electrocardiographic and routine biochemical and hematologic tests that would indicate an adverse effect of propionyl-L-carnitine. Adverse events requiring drug discontinuation (11 in the propionyl-L-carnitine group, 3 in the placebo group) were unrelated to study medication. The dose titration design of the study also provided information on the dose-response relation. Slightly less than 67% of patients were expected to improve their maximal walking distance by at least 30%, assuming 2 g/day of propionyl-L-carnitine (95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.70). The response rate during the entire titration course was significantly in favor of propionyl-L-carnitine compared with placebo. Although the precise mode of therapeutic action requires clarification, propionyl-L-carnitine, at a dose of 1 to 2 g/day, appears to be effective and well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects.",

These authors have also suggested that elevations in plasma esterified carnitine (EC) were due to the release of these carnitine esters from muscle during exercise. After 10 male subjects underwent 90 min of cycle egometry we found no alteration in muscle TC from preexercise values. Plasma EC progressively increased above resting values during exercise and remained elevated above rest at 0.75 and 1.5 h into recovery. Elevations of plasma EC were largely due to a decrement in free carnitine (FC) in both conditions. Immediately postexercise the urinary fractional reabsorbsion of EC and FC were similar to that at rest. These results suggest that a net loss of TC from exercising muscle does not occur. As in other conditions marked by falling insulin concentrations, elevations in plasma EC could result from an exchange of carnitine with the hepatic carnitine pool.",

          "content": "Carnitine plays a central role in fatty acid (FA) metabolism. It transports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Carnitine also modulates the metabolism of coenzyme-A (CoA). It is not surprising that the use of supplementary carnitine to improve physical performance has become widespread in recent years, although there is no unequivocal support to this practice. However, critical reflections and current scientific-based knowledge are important because the implications of reduced or increased carnitine concentrations in vivo are not thoroughly understood. Several rationales have been forwarded in support of the potential ergogenic effects of oral carnitine supplementation. However, the following arguments derived from established scientific observations may be forwarded: (i) carnitine supplementation neither enhances FA oxidation in vivo or spares glycogen or postpones fatigue during exercise. Carnitine supplementation does not unequivocally improve performance of athletes; (ii) carnitine supplementation does not reduce body fat or help to lose weight; (iii) in vivo pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is fully active already after a few seconds of intense exercise. Carnitine supplementation induces no further activation of PDC in vivo; (iv) despite an increased acetyl-CoA/free CoA ratio, PDC is not depressed during exercise in vivo and therefore supplementary carnitine has no effect on lactate accumulation; (v) carnitine supplementation per se does not affect the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max); (vi) during exercise there is a redistribution of free carnitine and acylcarnitines in the muscle but there is no loss of total carnitine. Athletes are not at risk for carnitine deficiency and do not have an increased need for carnitine. Although there are some theoretical points favouring potential ergogenic effects of carnitine supplementation, there is currently no scientific basis for healthy individuals or athletes to use carnitine supplementation to improve exercise performance.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of L-carnitine supplementation on NAFLD. We searched in four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) from inception to 1 November 2022 (updated on March 20, 2023) for potentially relevant records without language restrictions. We collected information on the first author, publication year, country, setting, study design, population characteristics, duration of follow-up, outcome variables of interest, and sources of funding. We used a modified Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the risk of bias, used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence, and used the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) tool to assess the credibility of any apparent subgroup effect. This systematic review and meta-analysis included eight eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Moderate credibility of ICEMAN results shows that L-carnitine supplementation has no difference in changes of AST and ALT levels in younger ones (MD: 0.5, 95%CI:\u2009-\u20090.70 to 1.70) but has significant changes (reduced) in adults (MD:\u2009-\u200920.3, 95%CI:\u2009-\u200928.62 to\u2009-\u200912.28)\u00a0compared to placebo.

          "content": "Patients on dialysis are in a chronic carnitine-deficient state. This condition may be associated with abnormalities of the fatty acid and organic acid metabolisms. Carnitine is required for \u03b2-oxidation of the long-chain fatty acids; therefore, carnitine deficiency decreases the efficiency of ATP synthesis and may incur death. However, the details of this association remain unknown. We examined the relationship between \u03b2-oxidation efficiency represented by the carnitine profile and 4-year all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients. The carnitine profiles of 122 hemodialysis patients were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The associations between the 4-year all-cause mortality and carnitine profile as well as the clinical backgrounds of the patients were investigated. A survival analysis was conducted by the Kaplan-Meier survival method and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis. The bootstrap method was performed to confirm the stability and robustness of our model. Of the 122 subjects analyzed, 111 were selected and 24 died during the observation period. Stepwise multivariable Cox regression demonstrated that diabetes state [Hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 4.981 (2.107-11.77)], age [HR (95% CI), 1.052 (1.014-1.091)], and the acetylcarnitine/(palmitoylcarnitine+octadecenoylcarnitine) [C2/(C16+C18:1)] ratio [HR (95% CI), 0.937 (0.904-0.971)] were independent significant factors of 4-year all-cause mortality. The bootstrap method confirmed the significance of these three factors. The 4-year all-cause mortality negatively correlated with the C2/(C16+C18:1) ratio.

The subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive either placebo containing maltodextrin or the nutrient mixture (HMB/Arg/Gln) containing 3 g HMB, 14 g L-glutamine, and 14 g L-arginine given in two divided doses daily for 8 weeks. Body weights (BW) were recorded weekly and lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass (FM) were measured by air displacement plethysmography and by a single computerized tomography (CT) slice through the thigh at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. Forty-three subjects completed the 8-week protocol, (placebo, n = 21; HMB/Arg/Gln, n = 22). At 8 weeks, the subjects consuming the HMB/Arg/Gln mixture gained 3.0 +/- 0.5 kg of BW while those supplemented with the placebo gained 0.37 +/- 0.84 kg (p = .009). The BW gain in the HMB/Arg/Gln-treated subjects was predominantly LBM (2.55 +/- 0.75 kg) compared with the placebo-supplemented subjects who lost lean mass (-0.70 +/- 0.69 kg, p = .003). No significant change in FM gain was observed (0.43 +/- 0.83 kg for the group receiving HMB/Arg/Gln and 1.07 +/- 0.64 kg for the group receiving the placebo, p > .20). Similar percentage changes in muscle mass and fat mass were observed with CT scans. Immune status was also improved as evident by an increase in CD3 and CD8 cells and a decrease in the HIV viral load with HMB/Arg/Gln supplementation. The data indicate that the HMB/Arg/Gln mixture can markedly alter the course of lean tissue loss in patients with AIDS-associated wasting.",

          "content": "The consumption of dietary amino acids has been evaluated for therapeutic and safety intervention in obesity. In particular, three molecules have been shown to be effective: arginine, glutamine and leucine (and its metabolite beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, HMB). This randomized, double-blinded pilot study in obese postmenopausal patients aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the administration of a specific food for special medical purposes (FSMP) consisting of arginine, glutamine and HMB on body composition, in particular, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), as the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate the effects on skin health through a validated self-reported questionnaire. A significant improvement on VAT of \u0394 = -153.600,  = 0.01 was recorded in the intervention group. Skin health showed a significant improvement in the treatment group for the following: bright \u0394 = 1.400 (0.758; 2.042), elasticity \u0394 = 0.900 (0.239; 1.561), wrinkles \u0394 = 0.800 (0.276; 1.324), and on total score, \u0394 = 3.000 (1.871; 4.129). In the intervention group, the improvement in VAT was associated with an improvement in the bright score (r = -0.58;  = 0.01). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the intake for 4-weeks of arginine, glutamine and HMB effects a significant reduction in VAT and improves skin condition, while fat free mass (FFM) is maintained, thus achieving \"high-quality\" weight loss.",

          "content": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of oral glutamine supplementation combined with resistance training in young adults. A group of 31 subjects, aged 18-24 years, were randomly allocated to groups (double blind) to receive either glutamine (0.9 g x kg lean tissue mass(-1) x day(-1); n = 17) or a placebo (0.9 g maltodextrin x kg lean tissue mass(-1) x day(-1); n = 14 during 6 weeks of total body resistance training. Exercises were performed for four to five sets of 6-12 repetitions at intensities ranging from 60% to 90% 1 repetition maximum (1 RM). Before and after training, measurements were taken of 1 RM squat and bench press strength, peak knee extension torque (using an isokinetic dynamometer), lean tissue mass (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) and muscle protein degradation (urinary 3-methylhistidine by high performance liquid chromatography). Repeated measures ANOVA showed that strength, torque, lean tissue mass and 3-methylhistidine increased with training (P < 0.05), with no significant difference between groups. Both groups increased their 1 RM squat by approximately 30% and 1 RM bench press by approximately 14%. The glutamine group showed increases of 6% for knee extension torque, 2% for lean tissue mass and 41% for urinary levels of 3-methylhistidine. The placebo group increased knee extension torque by 5%, lean tissue mass by 1.7% and 3-methylhistidine by 56%. We conclude that glutamine supplementation during resistance training has no significant effect on muscle performance, body composition or muscle protein degradation in young healthy adults.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia, characterized by degenerative skeletal muscle loss, is increasingly linked to poor surgical outcomes. Glutamine, an immune-modulating formula, may stimulate muscle protein synthesis and inhibit degradation. We used the psoas major muscle area (PMMA) at the third lumbar vertebra, normalized for height (PMMA index), as a skeletal muscle indicator. This study investigates whether perioperative glutamine supplementation mitigates psoas muscle atrophy. We enrolled gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) patients undergoing gastrectomy. Computed tomography assessed the psoas muscle short axis. Muscle atrophy was estimated by changes between preoperative and three-month post-gastrectomy scans. Perioperative glutamine supplementation (PGS) comprised five-day parenteral plus one-month oral use. Propensity score matching minimized potential bias. A linear regression model predicted the association. Of 516 patients analyzed (2016-2019), 100 (19.4%) received PGS. After propensity score matching, each group contained 97 cases. The PGS group showed a significantly higher median PMMA index change than the non-PGS group (0.3 vs. -0.3 cm/m,  = 0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed that PGS was significantly associated with increased PMMA index (coefficient = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.19-1.01;  = 0.005). PGS may help restore psoas muscle atrophy in GA patients undergoing gastrectomy. The underlying mechanisms likely relate to glutamine's role in protein metabolism and immune function. Further studies are needed to elucidate these mechanisms fully.",

          "content": "Glutamine is an amino acid essential for many important homeostatic functions and for the optimal functioning of a number of tissues in the body, particularly the immune system and the gut. However, during various catabolic states, such as infection, surgery, trauma and acidosis, glutamine homeostasis is placed under stress, and glutamine reserves, particularly in the skeletal muscle, are depleted. With regard to glutamine metabolism, exercise stress may be viewed in a similar light to other catabolic stresses. Plasma glutamine responses to both prolonged and high intensity exercise are characterised by increased levels during exercise followed by significant decreases during the post-exercise recovery period, with several hours of recovery required for restoration of pre-exercise levels, depending on the intensity and duration of exercise. If recovery between exercise bouts is inadequate, the acute effects of exercise on plasma glutamine level may be cumulative, since overload training has been shown to result in low plasma glutamine levels requiring prolonged recovery. Athletes suffering from the overtraining syndrome (OTS) appear to maintain low plasma glutamine levels for months or years. All these observations have important implications for organ functions in these athletes, particularly with regard to the gut and the cells of the immune system, which may be adversely affected. In conclusion, if methodological issues are carefully considered, plasma glutamine level may be useful as an indicator of an overtrained state.",

It is possible that glutamine exerts part of its beneficial effects by enhancing the availability of arginine. We aimed to quantify under postabsorptive conditions the metabolic pathway of plasma glutamine into arginine via the intermediate citrulline and to establish the contribution of the kidneys to the synthesis of arginine. The study was conducted in patients during surgery. The metabolism of glutamine, citrulline, and arginine was studied by using intravenous administration of stable isotope tracers of the amino acids. Results were interpreted by using established equations. Parametric tests were used to test and correlate results. P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Mean (+/-SE) whole-body plasma turnover rates of glutamine, citrulline, and arginine were 240 +/- 14, 6.2 +/- 0.6, and 42 +/- 2.9 micromol x kg(-1) x h(-1), respectively (P < 0.01). Plasma turnover of citrulline derived from glutamine was shown to be 5.1 +/- 0.7 micromol x kg(-1) x h(-1), and arginine derived from citrulline was shown to be 4.9 +/- 0.9 micromol x kg(-1) x h(-1) (P < 0.01). The contribution of plasma glutamine to plasma arginine derived from plasma citrulline was calculated to be 64%. The kidneys were observed to take up >50% of circulating plasma citrulline and to release equimolar amounts of arginine into plasma. This study shows that glutamine is an important precursor for the synthesis of arginine in humans.

Thirty-two severe burn patients who met the inclusion criteria and hospitalized in the Affiliated Huaihai Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from June 2017 to January 2019 were recruited into a prospectively randomized controlled study. According to the random number table, the patients were divided into conventional insulin therapy alone group, conventional insulin therapy+glutamine group, intensive insulin therapy alone group, and intensive insulin therapy+glutamine group, with 8 patients in each group, with genders of 5 males and 3 females, 4 males and 4 females, 3 males and 5 females, 4 males and 4 females, and ages of (35\u00b17), (36\u00b19), (33\u00b111), and (38\u00b17) years, respectively. Patients in conventional insulin therapy alone group were treated with conventional insulin therapy on the basis of routine treatment to control the blood glucose. Patients in conventional insulin therapy+glutamine group were supplemented with alanyl-glutamine for more than 14 days in addition to the treatment in conventional insulin therapy alone group. Patients in intensive insulin therapy alone group were treated with intensive insulin therapy on the basis of routine treatment to control the blood glucose. Patients in intensive insulin therapy+glutamine group were supplemented with alanyl-glutamine in addition to the treatment in intensive insulin therapy alone group. On treatment day (TD) 1, 3, 7, and 14, the blood glucose, albumin, prealbumin, white blood cell count, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) of patients in the 4 groups were detected. The cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), and pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) of patients in the 4 groups on TD 1, 3, and 7 were measured. Data were statistically analyzed with Fisher's exact probability test, one-way analysis of variance, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, and Bonferroni method.

Compared with those in intensive insulin therapy+glutamine group, the levels of prealbumin of patients in intensive insulin therapy alone group and conventional insulin therapy+glutamine group were significantly decreased on TD 1, 7, and 14 (<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the white blood cell count, PCT, and CRP of patients in the 4 groups in pairwise comparison between groups on TD 1, 3, 7, and 14 (>0.05). On TD 3 and 7, the levels of cardiac index, SVI, GEDVI, and SVRI of patients in intensive insulin therapy+glutamine group were significantly higher than those in conventional insulin therapy alone group (<0.05), while the levels of EVLWI and PVPI were significantly lower than those in conventional insulin therapy alone group (<0.05).  Glutamine combined with intensive insulin therapy can improve the hypermetabolism in patients after severe burns, reduce the decomposition and consumption of endogenous nutrient substrates, and at the same time help the recovery of cardiac function and maintenance of hemodynamic stability.",

Subjects were 28 men (age: 22.3 +/- 1.7 years; weight: 85.8 +/- 12.1 kg; height: 1.8 +/- 0.1 m) who had 2 or more years of resistance-training experience. A double blind, randomized trial was completed involving supplementation or placebo control and a progressive resistance-training program for 8 weeks. Dependent measures were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of resistance training. Both groups significantly improved MS and ME while the supplement group significantly increased body weight and fat-free mass. Control decreased body fat and increased fat-free mass. This study demonstrated that the supplement group did not enhance MS, ME, or BC significantly more than control after an 8-week resistance-training program.",

All 3 treatment groups participated in an identical periodized strength and conditioning program during preseason training. Body composition, vertical jump, and cycle performances were tested before (T1) and after (T2) the 8-week supplementation period. Body mass and lean body mass (LBM) increased at a greater rate for the CM and CG groups, compared with the P treatment. Additionally, the CM and CG groups exhibited significantly greater improvement in initial rate of power production, compared with the placebo treatment.

          "content": "Although beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine (Arg), and glutamine (Gln) may contribute to wound healing, no prospective studies have investigated the efficacy of a compound consisting of HMB, Arg, and Gln (HMB/Arg/Gln) for reducing wound complications following open abdominal surgery. This study evaluates the usefulness of perioperative nutrition using HMB/Arg/Gln in patients who were scheduled to undergo open surgery for abdominal malignancies in a randomized controlled trial. Patients scheduled for open surgery for abdominal malignancies were randomized to receive HMB/Arg/Gln (1.2 g HMB, 7 g L-Arg, and 7 g L-Gln) or placebo (isocaloric juice). The supplements were provided once daily for 3 days preoperatively and once daily for 7 days postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the incidence of wound complications. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of other complications, postoperative duration of hospital stay, total-body skeletal muscle mass, handgrip strength, and skin water content. Sixty-one patients were randomly assigned to either the HMB/Arg/Gln (n = 31) or the placebo (n = 30) group. One patient in the HMB/Arg/Gln group was ineligible because laparoscopic surgery was performed; thus, 60 patients were analyzed. The incidence of wound complications (20%) was the same in both groups (P = 1.000). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other complications, body composition, handgrip strength, or skin water content between the 2 groups. Serum growth hormone (GH) levels were significantly higher for patients whose total intake was > 80% of planned volume in the HMB/Arg/Gln group. The incidence of wound complications would not be reduced by perioperative HMB/Arg/Gln administration in patients who underwent open surgery. The efficacy of HMB/Arg/Gln for increasing serum GH levels needs to be validated in another large-scale randomized controlled trial.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence was conducted to obtain a conclusive result on the effects of glutamine supplementation on athletes. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data related to body mass, lean body mass, body fat percentage, Vo2 max, lymphocytes, leukocytes and neutrophil counts were extracted to determine the effects of GLN on performance outcomes. The literature search was conducted across the databases Pubmed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, SID (Scientific Information Database) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, covering a period up to January 2017. Clinical trials evaluating glutamine supplementation outcomes on athletes aged over 18 were included. A total of 47 studies were included in the systematic review, and 25 trials matched the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. According to the meta-analysis, glutamine has a significant effect on weight reduction (WMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.36 [95% CI:\u00a0-2.55 to\u00a0-0.16], p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Moreover, neutrophil numbers were reduced following glutamine intake at doses greater than 200\u00a0mg/kg body weight (WMD\u00a0=\u00a0-605.77 [95% CI:\u00a0-1200.0 to 52.1]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Also, supplementation by glutamine dipeptide resulted in higher blood glucose after exercise (WMD\u00a0=\u00a00.51 [95% CI: 0.18, 0.83] mmol/l; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). There was no association between glutamine ingestion and other outcomes investigated. According to this meta-analysis, generally, glutamine supplementation has no effect on athletics immune system, aerobic performance, and body composition. However, the current study showed that glutamine resulted in greater weight reduction. In addition, the present study suggests that the efficacy of glutamine supplementation on neutrophil numbers could be affected by supplement type and dose.",

Twelve females performed maximal eccentric resistance exercise using one arm and one leg. Blood leukocyte subsets and glutamine were measured at 24 and 0 h pre-exercise, and post-exercise at intervals up to 9 d post-exercise. Eleven subjects were placed in High (n = 6) and Low CK (n = 5) groups. Lymphocytes, (total, natural killer, and T), monocytes, and granulocytes did not change significantly in either group, at any time. Whole blood glutamine concentration decreased (p < 0.05) from 437 microM pre-exercise to 332 microM 3 d post-exercise in both groups. The decrease in glutamine suggests that the metabolism of the muscle may be affected by this exercise, however, the occurrence of this decrease in both groups suggests that this change was not a response to muscle damage.",

We examined the effects of whey protein and leucine ingestion post-exercise on neutrophil function and immunomodulators during a period of intense cycling. In a randomized double-blind crossover, 12 male cyclists ingested protein/leucine/carbohydrate/fat (LEUPRO 20/7.5/89/22 g h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric carbohydrate/fat control (CON 119/22 g h(-1)) beverages for 1-3 h post-exercise during 6 days of high-intensity training. Blood was taken pre- and post-exercise on days 1, 2, 4 and 6 for phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated neutrophil superoxide (O2 (-)) production, immune cell counts, amino acid and lipid metabolism via metabolomics, hormones (cortisol, testosterone) and cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-10). During recovery on day 1, LEUPRO ingestion increased mean concentrations of plasma amino acids (glycine, arginine, glutamine, leucine) and myristic acid metabolites (acylcarnitines C14, myristoylcarnitine; and C14:1-OH, hydroxymyristoleylcarnitine) with neutrophil priming capacity, and reduced neutrophil O2 production (15-17 mmol O2 (-) cell(-1) \u00b1 90 % confidence limits 20 mmol O2 (-) cell(-1)). On day 2, LEUPRO increased pre-exercise plasma volume (6.6 \u00b1 3.8 %) but haematological effects were trivial. LEUPRO supplementation did not substantially alter neutrophil elastase, testosterone, or cytokine concentrations. By day 6, however, LEUPRO reduced pre-exercise cortisol 21 % (\u00b115 %) and acylcarnitine C16 (palmitoylcarnitine) during exercise, and increased post-exercise neutrophil O2 (-) (33 \u00b1 20 mmol O2 (-) cell(-1)), relative to control. Altered plasma amino acid and acylcarnitine concentrations with protein-leucine feeding might partly explain the acute post-exercise reduction in neutrophil function and increased exercise-stimulated neutrophil oxidative burst on day 6, which could impact neutrophil-dependent processes during recovery from intense training.",

          "content": "This study aimed to determine the effect of postexercise protein-leucine coingestion with CHO-lipid on subsequent high-intensity endurance performance and to investigate candidate mechanisms using stable isotope methods and metabolomics. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 male cyclists ingested a leucine/protein/CHO/fat supplement (LEUPRO 7.5/20/89/22 g \u00b7 h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric CHO/fat control (119/22 g \u00b7 h(-1)) 1-3 h after exercise during a 6-d training block (intense intervals, recovery, repeated-sprint performance rides). Daily protein intake was clamped at 1.9 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (LEUPRO) and 1.5 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (control). Stable isotope infusions (1-(13)C-leucine and 6,6-(2)H2-glucose), mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and nitrogen balance methods were used to determine the effects of LEUPRO on whole-body branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and glucose metabolism and protein turnover. After exercise, LEUPRO increased BCAA levels in plasma (2.6-fold; 90% confidence limits = \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and urine (2.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.2) and increased products of BCAA metabolism plasma acylcarnitine C5 (3.0-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 0.9) and urinary leucine (3.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.3) and \u03b2-aminoisobutyrate (3.4-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.4), indicating that ingesting ~10 g leucine per hour during recovery exceeds the capacity to metabolize BCAA. Furthermore, LEUPRO increased leucine oxidation (5.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and nonoxidative disposal (4.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and left leucine balance positive relative to control. With the exception of day 1 (LEUPRO = 17 \u00b1 20 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = -90 \u00b1 44 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)), subsequent (days 2-5) nitrogen balance was positive for both conditions (LEUPRO = 130 \u00b1 110 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = 111 \u00b1 86 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)). Compared with control feeding, LEUPRO lowered the serum creatine kinase concentration by 21%-25% (90% confidence limits = \u00b1 14%), but the effect on sprint power was trivial (day 4 = 0.4% \u00b1 1.0%, day 6 = -0.3% \u00b1 1.0%). Postexercise protein-leucine supplementation saturates BCAA metabolism and attenuates tissue damage, but effects on subsequent intense endurance performance may be inconsequential under conditions of positive daily nitrogen balance.",

The objective was to examine the effect of a high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement on muscle mass preservation during intentional weight loss in obese older adults. We included 80 obese older adults in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. During a 13-wk weight loss program, all subjects followed a hypocaloric diet (-600 kcal/d) and performed resistance training 3\u00d7/wk. Subjects were randomly allocated to a high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement including a mix of other macro- and micronutrients (150 kcal, 21 g protein; 10\u00d7/wk, intervention group) or an isocaloric control. The primary outcome was change in appendicular muscle mass. The secondary outcomes were body composition, handgrip strength, and physical performance. Data were analyzed by using ANCOVA and mixed linear models with sex and baseline value as covariates. At baseline, mean \u00b1 SD age was 63 \u00b1 5.6 y, and body mass index (in kg/m(2)) was 33 \u00b1 4.4. During the trial, protein intake was 1.11 \u00b1 0.28 g \u00b7 kg body weight(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) in the intervention group compared with 0.85 \u00b1 0.24 g \u00b7 kg body weight(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) in the control group (P < 0.001). Both intervention and control groups decreased in body weight (-3.4 \u00b1 3.6 kg and -2.8 \u00b1 2.8 kg; both P < 0.001) and fat mass (-3.2 \u00b1 3.1 kg and -2.5 \u00b1 2.4 kg; both P < 0.001), with no differences between groups. The 13-wk change in appendicular muscle mass, however, was different in the intervention and control groups [+0.4 \u00b1 1.2 kg and -0.5 \u00b1 2.1 kg, respectively; \u03b2 = 0.95 kg (95% CI: 0.09, 1.81); P = 0.03]. Muscle strength and function improved over time without significant differences between groups. A high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement compared with isocaloric control preserves appendicular muscle mass in obese older adults during a hypocaloric diet and resistance exercise program and might therefore reduce the risk of sarcopenia. This trial was registered at the Dutch Trial Register (http://www.trialregister.nl) as NTR2751.",

Moreover, KCT improved (p < .003) 20-km cycling time-trial performance (37.80 \u00b1 2.28\u00a0min), compared with CHO-PLAC (39.40 \u00b1 3.33\u00a0min) but not versus KT (38.75 \u00b1 2.87\u00a0min; p < .09). 20-km cycling time-trial average power output was greater with KCT (power output = 180.5 \u00b1 28.7\u00a0W) versus both KT (170.9 \u00b1 31.7\u00a0W; p = .049) and CHO-PLAC (164.8 \u00b1 34.7\u00a0W; p = .001). Wingate peak power output was also greater for both KCT (1,134 \u00b1 137\u00a0W; p = .031) and KT (1,132 \u00b1 128\u00a0W; p = .039) versus CHO-PLAC (1,068 \u00b1 127\u00a0W). These data suggest that the observed improved exercise performance effects of this multi-ingredient supplement containing beta-hydroxybutyrate salts, taurine, and leucine are attributed partially to the addition of caffeine.",

          "content": "The primary objective of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available literature relating to leucine supplementation in the elderly with respect to its effects on anthropometrical parameters and muscle strength. The secondary aim was to perform a selective subgroup analysis when possible differentiating between healthy and sarcopenic subjects. Literature search was performed using the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, SportDiscus, and the Cochrane Central Register of trials with restrictions to randomized controlled trials or studies following a cross-over design. Parameters taken into account were body weight, body mass index, lean body mass, fat mass, percentage of body fat, hand grip strength, and knee extension strength. Moreover, biomarkers of glucose metabolism (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, albumin, and HOMA index) were extracted when possible. For each outcome measure of interest, a meta-analysis was performed in order to determine the pooled effect of the intervention in terms of weighted mean differences between the post-intervention (or differences in means) values of the leucine and the respective control groups. Data analysis was performed using the Review Manager 5.2.4. software. A total of 16 studies enrolling 999 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Compared with control groups, leucine supplementation significantly increased gain in body weight [mean differences 1.02 kg, 95%-CI (0.19, 1.85), p=0.02], lean body mass [mean differences 0.99 kg, 95%-CI (0.43, 1.55), p=0.0005], and body mass index [mean differences 0.33 kg/m2, 95%-CI (0.13, 0.53), p=0.001], when compared to the respective control groups. With respect to body weight and lean body mass, leucine supplementation turned out to be more effective in the subgroup of study participants with manifested sarcopenia. All other parameters under investigation were not affected by leucine supplementation in a fashion significantly different from controls. It is concluded that leucine supplementation was found to exert beneficial effects on body weight, body mass index, and lean body mass in older persons in those subjects already prone to sarcopenia, but not muscle strength. However, due to the heterogeneity between the trials included in this systematic review, further studies adopting a homogenous design with respect to participant characteristics duration as well as the kind and amount of daily supplement in use are required.",

To avoid this, resistance training has been proposed as an effective countermeasure, but the additional effect of a protein supplement is not so clear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a whey protein supplement enriched with leucine after resistance training on muscle mass and strength gains in a post-hospitalized elderly population. A total of 28 participants were included and allocated to either protein supplementation or placebo supplementation following resistance training for 12 weeks (2 days/week). Physical function (lower and upper body strength, aerobic capacity and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test), mini nutritional assessment (MNA) and body composition (Dual X-ray Absorptiometry) were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of resistance training. Both groups showed improvements in physical function after the intervention ( < 0.01), but there were no further effects for the protein group ( > 0.05). Muscle mass did not improve after resistance training in either group ( > 0.05). In conclusion, 12 weeks of resistance training are enough to improve physical function in a post-hospitalized elderly population with no further benefits for the protein-supplemented group.",

In study 1, subjects (n = 41) were randomized among three levels of HMB supplementation (0, 1.5 or 3.0 g HMB/day) and two protein levels (normal, 117 g/day, or high, 175 g/day) and weight lifted for 1.5 h 3 days/wk for 3 wk. In study 2, subjects (n = 28) were fed either 0 or 3.0 g HMB/day and weight lifted for 2-3 h 6 days/wk for 7 wk. In study 1, HMB significantly decreased the exercise-induced rise in muscle proteolysis as measured by urine 3-methylhistidine during the first 2 wk of exercise (linear decrease, P < 0.04). Plasma creatine phosphokinase was also decreased with HMB supplementation (week 3, linear decrease, P < 0.05). Weight lifted was increased by HMB supplementation when compared with the unsupplemented subjects during each week of the study (linear increase, P < 0.02). In study 2, fat-free mass was significantly increased in HMB-supplemented subjects compared with the unsupplemented group at 2 and 4-6 wk of the study (P < 0.05).

          "content": "Malnutrition adversely affects physical function and body composition in patients with chronic diseases. Leucine supplementation has shown benefits in improving body composition and clinical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a leucine-enriched oral nutritional supplement (ONS) on the nutritional status of patients at risk of malnutrition. This prospective observational study followed two cohorts of malnourished patients receiving personalized nutritional interventions over 3 months. One group received a leucine-enriched oral supplement (20 % protein, 100 % whey, 3 g leucine), while other received a standard supplement (hypercaloric and normo-hyperproteic) with mixed protein sources. Nutritional status was assessed at baseline and after 3 months using anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, AI assisted muscle ultrasound, and handgrip strength. A total of 142 patients were included (76 Leucine-ONS, 66 Standard-ONS), mostly women (65.5 %), mean age 62.00 (18.66) years. Malnutrition was present in 90.1 % and 34.5 % had sarcopenia. Cancer was the most common condition (30.3 %). The Leucine-ONS group showed greater improvements in phase angle (+2.08 % vs. -1.57 %; p = 0.02) and rectus femoris thickness (+1.72 % vs. -5.89 %; p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis confirmed associations between Leucine-ONS and improved phase angle (OR = 2.41; 95%CI: 1.18-4.92; p = 0.02) and reduced intramuscular fat (OR = 2.24; 95%CI: 1.13-4.46; p = 0.02). Leucine-enriched-ONS significantly improved phase angle and muscle thickness compared to standard ONS, supporting its role in enhancing body composition in malnourished patients. These results must be interpreted in the context of the observational design of the study, the heterogeneity of comparison groups and the short duration of intervention. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results and assess long-term clinical and functional outcomes.",

          "content": "Leucine is regarded as an anabolic trigger for the mTORC1 pathway and the stimulation muscle protein synthesis rates. More recently, there has been an interest in underpinning the relevance of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-containing dipeptides and their intact absorption into circulation to regulate muscle anabolic responses. We investigated the effects of dileucine and leucine ingestion on postprandial muscle protein turnover. Ten healthy young men (age: 23\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009yr) consumed either 2\u2009g of leucine (LEU) or 2\u2009g of dileucine (DILEU) in a randomized crossover design. The participants underwent repeated blood and muscle biopsy sampling during primed continuous infusions of l-[-C]phenylalanine and l-[N]phenylalanine to determine myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) and mixed muscle protein breakdown rates (MPB), respectively. LEU and DILEU similarly increased plasma leucine net area under the curve (AUC;  = 0.396). DILEU increased plasma dileucine AUC to a greater extent than LEU ( = 0.013). Phosphorylation of Akt ( = 0.002), rpS6 ( < 0.001), and p70S6K ( < 0.001) increased over time under both LEU and DILEU conditions. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 ( = 0.229) and eEF2 ( = 0.999) did not change over time irrespective of condition. Cumulative (0-180\u2009min) MPS increased in DILEU (0.075\u2009\u00b1\u20090.032%\u00b7h), but not in LEU (0.047\u2009\u00b1\u20090.029%\u00b7h;  = 0.023). MPB did not differ between LEU (0.043\u2009\u00b1\u20090.030%\u00b7h) and DILEU conditions (0.051\u2009\u00b1\u20090.027%\u00b7h;  = 0.659). Our results showed that dileucine ingestion elevated plasma dileucine concentrations and muscle protein turnover by stimulating MPS in young men. The role of dipeptides as anabolic agents remains unresolved in humans. We show that the ingestion of 2\u2009g dileucine increased plasma dileucine concentrations and resulted in an enhancement of muscle protein turnover by stimulating an increase in muscle protein synthesis rates in healthy young males. The ingestion of 2\u2009g leucine, however, did not stimulate an increase in muscle protein turnover. Our work provides the first insights into the effects of dipeptides on human protein metabolism.",

          "content": "Background: In patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS), lifestyle interventions combining diet, in particular, and physical exercise are recommended as the first line treatment. Previous studies have suggested that leucine or arginine supplementation may have beneficial effects on the body composition or insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, respectively. We thus conducted a randomized controlled study to evaluate the effects of a supervised adapted physical activity program associated or not with oral supplementation with leucine and arginine in MetS-complicated patients with obesity. Methods: Seventy-nine patients with obesity and MetS were randomized in four groups: patients receiving arginine and leucine supplementation (ALs group, n = 20), patients on a supervised adapted physical activity program (APA group, n = 20), patients combining ALs and APA (ALs+APA group, n = 20), and a control group (n = 19). After the baseline evaluation (m0), patients received ALs and/or followed the APA program for 6 months (m6). Body composition, MetS parameters, lipid and glucose metabolism markers, inflammatory markers, and a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) were assessed at m0, m6, and after a 3-month wash-out period (m9). Results: After 6 months of intervention, we did not observe variable changes in body weight, body composition, lipid and glucose metabolism markers, inflammatory parameters, or quality of life scores between the four groups. However, during the CPET, the maximal power (Pmax and Ppeak), power, and O2 consumption at the ventilatory threshold (P(VT) and O2(VT)) were improved in the APA and ALs+APA groups (p < 0.05), as well as the forced vital capacity (FVC). Between m6 and m9, a gain in fat mass was only observed in patients in the APA and ALs+APA groups. Conclusion: In our randomized controlled trial, arginine and leucine supplementation failed to improve MetS in patients with obesity, as did the supervised adapted physical activity program and the combination of both. Only the cardiorespiratory parameters were improved by exercise training.",

          "content": "\u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a leucine metabolite that is purported to increase fat-free mass (FFM) gain and performance in response to resistance exercise training (RET). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of HMB supplementation in augmenting FFM and strength gains during RET in young adults. Outcomes investigated were: total body mass (TBM), FFM, fat mass (FM), total single repetition maximum (1RM), bench press (BP) 1RM, and lower body (LwB) 1RM. Databases consulted were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (Embase), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SportDiscus. Fourteen studies fit the inclusion criteria; however, 11 were analyzed after data extraction and funnel plot analysis exclusion. A total of 302 participants (18-45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 248 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes. We conclude that HMB produces a small effect on TBM gain, but this effect does not translate into significantly greater increases in FFM, strength or decreases in FM during periods of RET. Our findings do not support the use of HMB aiming at improvement of body composition or strength with RET.",

          "content": "Malnutrition and metabolic alterations of cancer cachexia are often associated with negative weight loss and muscle mass wasting. In this sense, protein supplementation can be a strategy to help counteract the loss and/or maintenance of mass in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of leucine supplementation on body composition in outpatients with gastrointestinal tract cancer. It was a randomized, blinded, controlled, parallel trial, performed in male patients with a cancer diagnosis of the gastrointestinal tract and appendix organs undergoing chemotherapy. All the patients were allocated to one of the protocol groups: L-leucine supplement or the control group, during 8 weeks of intervention. We evaluated the body composition through bioelectrical impedance analysis, the cancer cachexia classification, and the diet intake before and after the intervention protocol. The intention-to-treat approach was performed to predict the missing values for all patients who provide any observation data. The patients were an average age of 65.11 \u00b1 7.50 years old. In the body composition analysis with patients who finished all the supplementation, we observed a significant gain in body weight (61.79.9 \u00b1 9.02 versus 64.06 \u00b1 9.45,  = 0.01), ASMM (7.64 \u00b1 1.24 versus 7.81 \u00b1 1.20,  = 0.02) in the Leucine group, whereas patients in the control did not present significant variation in these parameters. There was no significant intergroup difference. While in the analysis included the patients with intention-to-treat, we found a significant increase in body weight ( = 0.01), BMI ( = 0.01), FFM ( = 0.03), and ASMM ( = 0.01) in the Leucine group. No significant intergroup differences. These results also similar among cachectic patients. A balanced diet enriched with free-Leucine supplementation was able to promotes gains in body weight and lean mass in older men diagnosticated with gastrointestinal and appendix organs of digestion cancer after 8 weeks. However, the fact that most men are non-cachectic or pre-cachectic is not clear if the increase in muscle mass was due to a high intake of leucine, since no difference between groups was detected. Moreover, we know that benefits on body composition are due to adequate calorie and macronutrients consumption and that balanced feeding according to nutrition Guidelines seems crucial and must be advised during the oncological treatment.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of age on whole-body amino acid turnover in response to eccentric exercise and hyperglycemia-induced hyperinsulinemia. 16 healthy men were divided into young (N=8) and older (N=8) groups. Protein metabolism was assessed using a [1-13C]-leucine isotopic tracer approach. Measures were obtained under fasted basal conditions and during 3-h hyperglycemic clamps that were performed without (control) and 48 h after eccentric exercise. Exercise reduced leucine oxidation in the younger men (P<0.05), but not in older men. Insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated with leucine oxidation (P<0.05), and was lower in older men (P<0.05). Healthy aging is associated with an impaired capacity to adjust protein oxidation in response to eccentric exercise. The decreased efficiency of protein utilization in older men may contribute to impaired maintenance, growth, and repair of body tissues with advancing age.",

J Strength Cond Res 38(3): 526-532, 2024-This study examined the effects of supplementing 5 g of leucine compared with a placebo during a 10-week resistance training program on body composition parameters and adipokine concentrations in untrained, perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Thirty-five women were randomly assigned to 2 groups-leucine (LEU, n = 17) and placebo (PLC, n = 18)-in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Each group consumed the supplement or placebo every day and completed a resistance training program for 10 weeks. Using 3-day food records, a diet was assessed before the intervention and after its cessation. Body composition was assessed preintervention and postintervention using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Moreover, the concentrations of adipokines, such as adiponectin, visfatin, leptin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), were assessed preintervention and postintervention. Both groups showed an increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area ( p = 0.030) and fat-free mass (FFM; p = 0.023). There were significant group differences in concentrations of visfatin ( p = 0.020) and leptin ( p = 0.038) between the PLC and LEU groups. Visfatin displayed higher concentrations in the PLC group and leptin displayed higher concentrations in the LEU group. In addition, there were significant decreases in adiponectin concentrations for both groups (LEU: 652 \u00b1 513 to 292 \u00b1 447 pg\u00b7ml -1 ; PLC: 584 \u00b1 572 to 245 \u00b1 356 pg\u00b7ml -1 , p = 0.002) and MCP-1 only decreased in the PLC group (253 \u00b1 119 to 206 \u00b1 106 pg\u00b7ml -1 , p = 0.004). There were significant decreases in adiponectin concentrations in both groups and a decrease in MCP-1 concentrations in the PLC group. These decreases may be due to both adipokines possible relationship with VAT area. However, it is not known whether leucine has underlying properties that hinder changes in MCP-1 concentrations.",

Anthropometric variables were also measured following a one-year follow-up (F). Significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) group x time interactions were found for testosterone and testosterone to cortisol ratio (T/C). Both variables were greater in BG at P2 and P3 compared to P1, however, the testosterone was less in the PG at P3 compared to P2. There was no significant group by time interactions for GH, IGF-1, lean body mass, or body fat. There was a significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) group x time interaction in height and weight at F, with the greater increases in BG compared to PG. Betaine supplementation increased testosterone levels and T/C ratio in youth professional soccer players during a competitive season. Betaine supplementation had no negative effects on growth (height and weight) and may attenuate reductions in testosterone due to intense training during puberty.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effects of betaine supplementation on body composition indices (body mass (BM), BMI, body fat percentage (BFP), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM)), and dietary intakes. Studies examining the effects of betaine supplementation on body composition and dietary intakes published up to August 2021 were identified through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, SCOPUS and Ovid databases. Betaine supplementation failed to significantly affect BM ((weighted mean difference (WMD): -0\u00b740 kg, 95 % CI -1\u00b746, 0\u00b764),  = 0\u00b7447), BMI ((WMD: -0\u00b705 kg/m, 95 % CI -0\u00b736, 0\u00b725),  = 0\u00b7719), BFP ((WMD: 0\u00b726 %, 95 % CI -0\u00b782, 1\u00b736),  = 0\u00b7663), FM ((WMD: -0\u00b757 kg, 95 % CI -2\u00b714, 0\u00b799),  = 0\u00b7473) and FFM ((WMD: 0\u00b761 kg, 95 % CI -1\u00b727, 2\u00b749),  = 0\u00b7527).

We aim to investigate the association between serum choline and betaine levels with body composition in general population. This is an observational cross-sectional study performed in 1081 subjects from the CODING (Complex Disease in Newfoundland population: Environment and Genetics) study. Serum choline and betaine levels were measured based on liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry technology. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry following a 12-hour fast. Major confounding factors including age, sex, total calorie intake and physical activity level were controlled in all analyses. Significantly inverse correlations were found between serum betaine levels and all obesity measurements in males (r ranged from -0.12 to -0.23, and p<0.01 for all) but not in females. Serum choline was negatively associated with total percent body fat (%BF), percent trunk fat (%TF), weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (r ranged from -0.11 to -0.19, and p<0.05 for all) in males and positively associated with weight, BMI and WC (r ranged from 0.09 to 0.10, and p<0.05 for all) in females. The negative associations between serum choline and betaine levels with obesity in males were more profound in those not on any medication than those taking medications. Moreover, obese males had the lowest serum choline and betaine levels, followed by overweight males, and normal weight males having the highest serum choline and betaine levels, especially in those not taking medications (p<0.05). Likewise, subjects with the highest serum levels of both had the lowest obesity indexes, especially those not taking medications. Higher serum choline and betaine levels were associated with a more favorable body composition (lower body fat and higher lean body mass) in males and the favorable association was more pronounced in non-medication users.",

          "content": "This study examined the effects of 2 weeks of betaine versus placebo supplementation (3 g/d) on 60 km cycling performance, gut permeability, and shifts in plasma metabolites. Participants included 21 male and female non-elite cyclists. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design was used with two 2-week supplementation periods and a 2-week washout period. Supplementation periods were followed by a 60 km cycling time trial. Six blood samples were collected before and after supplementation (overnight fasted state), and at 0 h, 1.5 h, 3 h, and 24 h post-exercise. Five-hour urine samples were collected pre-supplementation and post-60 km cycling after ingesting a sugar solution containing lactulose 5 g, C mannitol 100 mg, and C mannitol 1.9 g in 450 mL water. Other outcome measures included plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein-1 (I-FABP), muscle damage biomarkers (serum creatine kinase, myoglobin), serum cortisol, complete blood cell counts, and shifts in plasma metabolites using untargeted metabolomics. The time to complete the 60 km cycling bout differed significantly between the betaine and placebo trials (mean \u00b1 SE, 112.8 \u00b1 2.3, 114.2 \u00b1 2.6 min, respectively, (-1.41 \u00b1 0.7 min) (effect size = 0.475,  = 0.042). No trial differences were found for I-FABP (interaction effect,  = 0.076), L:CM ( = 0.559), the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio ( = 0.171), serum cortisol ( = 0.982), serum myoglobin ( = 0.942), or serum creatine kinase ( = 0.694). Untargeted metabolomics showed that 214 metabolites exhibited significant trial treatment effects and 130 significant trial x time interaction effects. Betaine versus placebo supplementation was linked to significant increases in plasma betaine, dimethylglycine (DMG), sarcosine, methionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), alpha-ketoglutaramate, and 5'methylthioadensone (MTA), and decreases in plasma carnitine and numerous acylcarnitines. Betaine supplementation modestly improved 60 km cycling performance but had no effect on gut permeability. The metabolomics data supported a strong influence of 2-week intake of betaine on the one-carbon metabolism pathway during the 24 h recovery period.",

The registry included patients of all ages with homocystinuria who were treated with betaine anhydrous in conjunction with other therapies. Clinical data were collected retrospectively from 2007 to 2013, then prospectively up to February 2014. All adverse events (AEs) reported during the study were recorded. The clinical and biological status of patients was monitored at least once a year. A total of 125 patients with homocystinuria (adults [>\u200918\u2009years]: 50; paediatric [\u226418\u2009years]: 75) were enrolled at 29 centres in France and Spain. Patients were treated with betaine anhydrous for a mean duration of 7.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3\u2009years. The median total daily dose of betaine anhydrous at the first and last study visits was 6\u2009g/day for cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS)-deficient vitamin B6 responders and 9\u2009g/day for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase-deficient patients, while the median daily dose increased in CBS-deficient B6 non-responders (from 6 to 9\u2009g/day) and cobalamin metabolism-defective patients (from 3 to 6\u2009g/day) between the first and last visits. Treatment caused a mean overall reduction of 29% in plasma homocysteine levels in the study population. A total of 277 AEs were reported during the study, of which two non-serious AEs (bad taste and headache) and one serious AE (interstitial lung disease) were considered to be drug related. Overall, betaine anhydrous was well tolerated with no major safety concerns. Data from the RoCH registry provided real-world evidence on the clinical safety and efficacy of betaine anhydrous in the management of homocystinuria in paediatric and adult patients.",

However, no longitudinal study has been conducted to illustrate if choline and betaine have long-term effects on changes in body composition. This study aimed to prospectively investigate the association between serum choline and betaine concentrations and 3-year changes in body composition in community-dwelling Chinese adults. This present analysis used data from 1384 women and 554 men aged 40-75 years. Serum concentrations of betaine and choline at baseline were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Body composition parameters, i.e., muscle mass (MM), fat mass (FM), and body fat percentage (FM%) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the first and the second follow-ups. After adjustment for potential cofounders, higher serum choline concentrations were associated with a lower decrease in MM in men (\u03b2 = 0.022,  = 0.025) and a lower increase in FM and FM% in women with baseline choline concentrations below 21.5 \u03bcmol/L (all  for nonlinearity = 0.007); higher serum betaine concentrations were associated with a lower decline in MM and a lower increase in FM and FM% among men whose betaine concentrations were lower than 55 \u03bcmol/L (all  for nonlinearity < 0.05). These findings suggest that higher concentrations of serum choline and betaine may be associated with favorable changes in body composition profiles among men and women who have relatively low concentrations, especially in men.  Higher concentrations of serum choline and betaine were associated with favorable changes in body composition. Such favorable associations were more pronounced in men.",

We studied the associations between cognitive function and plasma concentrations of free choline and betaine.

Compared with low concentrations, high choline (>8\u00b74 \u03bcmol/l) was associated with better test scores in the TMT-A (56\u00b70 v. 61\u00b75, P=0\u00b7004), m-DST (10\u00b75 v. 9\u00b78, P=0\u00b7005) and m-MMSE (11\u00b75 v. 11\u00b74, P=0\u00b701). A generalised additive regression model showed a positive dose-response relationship between the m-MMSE and choline (P=0\u00b7012 from a corresponding linear regression model).

Risk ratios (RR) for poor test performance roughly tripled when low choline was combined with either low plasma vitamin B\u2081\u2082 (\u2264257 pmol/l) concentrations (RR(KOLT)=2\u00b76, 95 % CI 1\u00b71, 6\u00b71; RR(m-MMSE)=2\u00b77, 95 % CI 1\u00b71, 6\u00b76; RR(COWAT)=3\u00b71, 95 % CI 1\u00b74, 7\u00b72) or high methylmalonic acid (MMA) (\u22653\u00b795 \u03bcmol/l) concentrations (RR(m-BD)=2\u00b78, 95 % CI 1\u00b73, 6\u00b71). Low betaine (\u226431\u00b71 \u03bcmol/l) combined with high MMA was associated with elevated RR on KOLT (RR(KOLT)=2\u00b75, 95 % CI 1\u00b70, 6\u00b72). Low plasma free choline concentrations are associated with poor cognitive performance. There were significant interactions between low choline or betaine and low vitamin B\u2081\u2082 or high MMA on cognitive performance.",

          "content": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a major public health crisis with significant health threats and economic burdens worldwide in the past decades. Betaine, a naturally occurring alkaloid compound present in various dietary sources including spinach and beets, has been shown to ameliorate hepatic lipid metabolism and attenuate (NAFLD), while the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we propose a novel mechanism through which betaine exerts its protective effects against hepatic lipid accumulation and (NAFLD) from an epigenetics perspective. Specifically, we discover that betaine upregulates betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) expression, leading to increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production and subsequent upregulation of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) expression. Increased abundance of FTO targets peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1) mRNA and reduces the N-methyladenosine (mA) level in the CDS of Ppargc1\u03b1 transcript, which positively regulates PGC1\u03b1 expression and subsequently inhibits hepatic lipid accumulation. Overall, our works demonstrate that betaine may be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating (NAFLD) and improving liver function through the regulation of (NADPH) and mA-mediated pathways.",

We hypothesized that lower folate, choline, betaine, and glutathione (GSH) concentrations but higher total homocysteine and\u00a0trimethylamine N-oxide concentrations\u00a0are\u00a0associated with fatty liver (FL) in postmenopausal women. We aimed to identify relationships between OCM and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease biomarkers in postmenopausal women. A total of 131 postmenopausal women participated in this study and were stratified by the incidence of FL based on the hepatic steatosis index (HSI). Food intake was evaluated using dietary records. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations in serum were measured using the colorimetric method. Total homocysteine and GSH concentrations in plasma were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Folate and phosphatidylcholine (PC) concentrations were determined in red blood cells using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Other OCM biomarkers concentrations were measured using the isotope dilution analysis. Women with FL (HSI > 36) had lower GSH, choline, and betaine concentrations than women without FL (HSI < 36). Higher HSI level was negatively correlated with betaine and PC and positively correlated with plasma choline/betaine ratio. Lower GSH and higher carnitine concentrations in the blood are associated with an increased risk of FL. MTHFR (rs180130) T-allele carriers had lower levels of GSH than the CC homozygotes. Postmenopausal women with FL have lower GSH, choline, and betaine concentrations, which may play a role in fat accumulation in the liver. It seems important to consider the dietary intakes of these nutrients in postmenopausal women.",

          "content": "Betaine supplementation has been shown to improve body composition and some metrics of muscular performance in young men; but, whether betaine enhances body composition or performance in female subjects is currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between resistance training adaptation and chronic betaine supplementation in females. Twenty-three young women (21.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u00a0years, 165.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u00a0cm, 68.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8\u00a0kg) without prior structured resistance training experience volunteered for this study. Body composition (BodPod), rectus femoris muscle thickness (B-mode Ultrasound), vertical jump, back squat 1RM and bench press 1RM were assessed pre- and post-training. Following 1\u00a0week of familiarization training, subjects were matched for body composition and squat strength, and randomly assigned to either a betaine (2.5\u00a0g/day; n\u2009=\u200911) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200912) group that completed 3 sets of 6-7 exercises per day performed to momentary muscular failure. Training was divided into two lower and one upper body training sessions per week performed on non-consecutive days for 8\u00a0weeks, and weekly volume load was used to analyze work capacity. Significant main effects of time were found for changes in lean mass (2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u00a0kg), muscle thickness (0.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u00a0cm), vertical jump (1.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u00a0cm), squat 1RM (39.8\u2009\u00b1\u200914.0\u00a0kg), and bench press 1 RM (9.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\u00a0kg); however, there were no significant interactions. A trend (p\u2009=\u2009.056) was found for greater weekly training volumes for betaine versus placebo. Significant interactions were found for changes in body fat percentage and fat mass: body fat percentage and fat mass decreased significantly more in betaine (-\u20093.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7%; -\u20092.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u00a0kg) compared to placebo (-\u20091.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6%; -\u20090.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u00a0kg), respectively. The results of this study indicated that betaine supplementation may enhance reductions in fat mass, but not absolute strength, that accompany a resistance training program in untrained collegiate females.",

          "content": "Animal studies have suggested that betaine, but not choline, may improve body composition, but little evidence is available in humans. We examined the association of serum concentrations of choline and betaine with body composition and fat distribution in adults. This community-based study recruited 1996 adults (women/men: 1380/616) aged 40-75 years in urban Guangzhou, China. General information and anthropometric measurements were taken, and serum choline and betaine levels were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry between July 2008 and June 2010. After 3.2 years, 1623 of the 1996 participants were measured for fat mass (FM and %FM) over the total body (TB), trunk, limbs, android (A) and gynoid (G) regions. The %FM ratios of the A/G regions and the trunk and limbs were determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Univariate analyses showed that higher serum betaine levels were significantly associated with lower values of adiposity indices (all P-trends<0.05), except in the case of the %FM at the gynoid area. After adjusting for potential covariates, similar associations were observed. The mean percentage differences between quartiles 4 and 1 of the serum betaine levels were -4.9% (weight), -4.7% (body mass index, BMI), -2.5% (waist circumference), -7.9% (TB FM) and -3.4% (TB %FM). The mean differences in the FM and %FM were much more pronounced at the trunk (-10.0 and -4.5%) or android areas (-10.7 and -4.7%) than those at the limbs (-0.8 and -2.3%) or gynoid areas (-0.6 and -1.4%). Such favorable associations were stronger in men than in women. No significant associations between serum choline and the adiposity indices were observed, except in the cases of body weight and BMI. Greater circulating betaine, but not choline, was dose-dependently associated with better body composition and fat distribution due to a lower FM in the trunk regions in this population.",

          "content": "Neural tube defects (NTD) are common malformations resulting from incomplete closure of the neural tube in the first month after conception. Since genetic deficiencies in folate-dependent homocysteine metabolism have been identified in NTD families, we investigated a common variant in betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), 742G-->A (R239Q), as a genetic modifier of NTD risk. Genotypes, nutrient levels, and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) were assessed in 54 patients with spina bifida, 57 mothers of patients, 93 control children, and 86 mothers of controls. The QQ genotype (present in 17% and 7% of the control and case mothers, respectively, and in 12% and 6% of the control and case children, respectively) was associated with a decreased risk of NTD (odds ratios of 0.52 (95% CI 0.13-2.05) for children and 0.37 (95% CI 0.11-1.22) for mothers). The small sample size limited the statistical power of the analyses, but these decreases, although not statistically significant, are compatible with a protective effect. We did not observe statistically-significant genotype-dependent differences in plasma homocysteine, although women with the QQ genotype did have lower homocysteine; in children, the mean homocysteine level was higher in the QQ group. This inconsistency could be explained by the fact that age is a strong determinant of homocysteine in children and the QQ group was on average older than the other genotype groups. Our study suggests that the Q allele of the R239Q mutation may decrease risk of the condition. This warrants further investigation of its relationship with the development of NTD.",

There are numerous studies with inconsistent results that evaluated the association between dietary choline intakes with cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between dietary betaine and choline intakes with cardio-metabolic risk factors is not well studied. In the current study, our aim was to evaluate dietary choline and betaine intakes in the usual diet of obese individuals and to assess its association with serum lipids, blood pressure and glycemic markers among obese individuals. We recruited a total number of 359 obese people aged between 20 and 50 years in the present study. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used for dietary assessment; dietary choline and betaine intakes were calculated using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) database. National cholesterol education program adult treatment panel (NCEP-ATP)-III criteria was used metabolic syndrome (MetS) definition. Enzymatic methods were used to assess biochemical variables. Body composition was measured with the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method. Higher body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), fat-free mass (FFM) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were observed in higher tertiles of dietary choline intake (P\u2009<\u20090.01). There was no significant difference in terms of biochemical parameters among different tertiles of dietary choline intake, while systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were reduced in higher betaine tertiles (P\u2009<\u20090.05). For total dietary choline and betaine intakes, there was a reduction in DBP and low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Also, a non-significant reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and MetS prevalence was observed in higher tertiles of dietary choline and betaine intakes. After classification of the study population according to MetS status, there was no significant difference in biochemical variables in subjects with MetS (P\u2009>\u20090.05), while in the non-MetS group, SBP, DBP, TG and insulin levels reduced in higher tertiles of dietary betaine and choline (P\u2009>\u20090.05). According to our findings, higher dietary intakes of choline and betaine were associated with lower levels of blood pressure and LDL concentrations among obese individuals.

We aimed to prospectively investigate the relationships of circulating choline and betaine with cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic stroke. We performed a nested case-control study within the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke. A total of 323 cardiovascular events (including 264 recurrent strokes) and 323 controls (free of recurrent cardiovascular events) matched for age (\u00b11 y), sex, and treatment group were included. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events after ischemic stroke. Plasma choline and betaine were measured at baseline by ultra-high-performance LC-MS/MS. Conditional logistic regression models were applied, and discrimination, reclassification, and calibration of models with choline pathway metabolites were evaluated. Plasma choline and betaine were inversely associated with cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke after ischemic stroke. Specifically, in fully adjusted models, each additional SD of choline and betaine was associated with 35% (95% CI: 20%-48%) and 30% (95% CI: 14%-43%) decreased risks of subsequent cardiovascular events, respectively, and 34% (95% CI: 16%-48%) and 29% (95% CI: 12%-43%) decreased risks of recurrent stroke, respectively. In addition, both choline and betaine offered substantial risk discrimination and reclassification improvement for cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke beyond traditional risk factors, as evidenced by an increase in C statistics, the net reclassification index, and integrated discrimination improvement. Plasma choline pathway metabolites, including choline and betaine, were associated with decreased risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke and provided incremental value in risk discrimination and stratification in patients with ischemic stroke. This nested case-control study was based on the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke, which is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01840072.",

          "content": "Tribulus terrestris is an herbal nutritional supplement that is promoted to produce large gains in strength and lean muscle mass in 5-28 days (15, 18). Although some manufacturers claim T. terrestris will not lead to a positive drug test, others have suggested that T. terrestris may increase the urinary testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) ratio, which may place athletes at risk of a positive drug test. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of T. terrestris on strength, fat free mass, and the urinary T/E ratio during 5 weeks of preseason training in elite rugby league players. Twenty-two Australian elite male rugby league players (mean +/- SD; age = 19.8 +/- 2.9 years; weight = 88.0 +/- 9.5 kg) were match-paired and randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to either a T. terrestris (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11) group. All subjects performed structured heavy resistance training as part of the club's preseason preparations. A T. terrestris extract (450 mg.d(-1)) or placebo capsules were consumed once daily for 5 weeks. Muscular strength, body composition, and the urinary T/E ratio were monitored prior to and after supplementation. After 5 weeks of training, strength and fat free mass increased significantly without any between-group differences. No between-group differences were noted in the urinary T/E ratio. It was concluded that T. terrestris did not produce the large gains in strength or lean muscle mass that many manufacturers claim can be experienced within 5-28 days. Furthermore, T. terrestris did not alter the urinary T/E ratio and would not place an athlete at risk of testing positive based on the World Anti-Doping Agency's urinary T/E ratio limit of 4:1.",

          "content": "Tribulus terrestris L. (TT) ingredients have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, but their effects on exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) in trained athletes are uncertain. The purpose of this single-blind placebo-controlled trial, in accordance with CONSORT guidelines, was to examine the effect of 6 weeks of TT supplementation on muscle metabolism, inflammation biomarkers, and oxidant status. Thirty trained male CrossFit\u00ae athletes were randomly assigned to be supplemented with 770 mg/day of TT (intervention group (IG)) or receive a placebo daily (control group (CG)) for 6 weeks. Muscle damage enzymes, inflammation biomarkers, and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) were assessed at baseline (T1), 21 days after baseline (T2), and after 42 days (T3). Grace, a Workout of the Day, was measured in T1 and T3. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was found between IG and CG in Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and TAS levels at the end of the follow-up. Furthermore, TAS levels were significantly (p < 0.05) lower at T2 and T3 relative to baseline in the IG, also LDH and CRP increased significantly (p < 0.05) at T2 and T3 relative to baseline in the CG. No significant (p > 0.05) decreases in muscle damage or inflammation biomarkers were observed, although a slight downward trend was observed after 6 weeks for supplemented athletes. TT supplementation could attenuate the CrossFit\u00ae training program-induced oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inflammation which could be due to the natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of TT.",

          "content": "Tribulus terrestris is a nutritional supplement highly debated regarding its physiological and actual effects on the organism. The main claimed effect is an increase of testosterone anabolic and androgenic action through the activation of endogenous testosterone production. Even if this biological pathway is not entirely proven, T. terrestris is regularly used by athletes. Recently, the analysis of two female urine samples by GC/C/IRMS (gas chromatography/combustion/isotope-ratio-mass-spectrometry) conclusively revealed the administration of exogenous testosterone or its precursors, even if the testosterone glucuronide/epitestosterone glucuronide (T/E) ratio and steroid marker concentrations were below the cut-off values defined by World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). To argue against this adverse analytical finding, the athletes recognized having used T. terrestris in their diet. In order to test this hypothesis, two female volunteers ingested 500 mg of T. terrestris, three times a day and for two consecutive days. All spot urines were collected during 48 h after the first intake. The (13)C/(12)C ratio of ketosteroids was determined by GC/C/IRMS, the T/E ratio and DHEA concentrations were measured by GC/MS and LH concentrations by radioimmunoassay. None of these parameters revealed a significant variation or increased above the WADA cut-off limits. Hence, the short-term treatment with T. terrestris showed no impact on the endogenous testosterone metabolism of the two subjects.",

Herein we present a case with acute massive pulmonary embolism while using an herbal combination in the context of Tribulus terrestris, Avena sativa and Panax ginseng. A 41-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with the complaint of sudden onset of dyspnea and syncope. As a result of investigations (blood gases, echocardiography, ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy) he was diagnosed with an acute massive pulmonary embolism. The patient's use of panax did not pose as a risk factor for the pulmonary embolism. He was given thrombolytic therapy and shortness of breath improved. At the pre-discharge the patient was informed of the risks associated with the herbal combination, especially panax. Coumadin was started and he was discharged for the INR checks to come.",

The experimental groups were named TT1 and TT2 and the subjects were assigned to consume 20 and 10 mg/kg body weight per day of Tribulus terrestris extract, respectively, separated into three daily intakes for 4 weeks. Testosterone, androstenedione and luteinizing hormone levels in the serum were measured 24 h before supplementation (clear probe), and at 24, 72, 240, 408 and 576 h from the beginning of the supplementation. There was no significant difference between Tribulus terrestris supplemented groups and controls in the serum testosterone (TT1 (mean+/-S.D.: 15.75+/-1.75 nmol/l); TT2 (mean+/-S.D.: 16.32+/-1.57 nmol/l); controls (mean+/-S.D.: 17.74+/-1.09 nmol/l) (p>0.05)), androstenedione (TT1 (mean+/-S.D.: 1.927+/-0.126 ng/ml); TT2 (mean+/-S.D.: 2.026+/-0.256 ng/ml); controls (mean+/-S.D.: 1.952+/-0.236 ng/ml) (p>0.05)) or luteinizing hormone (TT1 (mean+/-S.D.: 4.662+/-0.274U/l); TT2 (mean+/-S.D.: 4.103+/-0.869U/l); controls (mean+/-S.D.: 4.170+/-0.406U/l) (p>0.05)) levels. All results were within the normal range. The findings in the current study anticipate that Tribulus terrestris steroid saponins possess neither direct nor indirect androgen-increasing properties. The study will be extended in the clarifying the probable mode of action of Tribulus terrestris steroid saponins.",

A 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted. Fibromyalgia patients were randomly assigned to receive either creatine monohydrate or placebo in a double-blind manner. The patients were evaluated at baseline and after 16 weeks. Muscle function, aerobic conditioning, cognitive function, quality of sleep, quality of life, kidney function, and adverse events were assessed. Muscle phosphorylcreatine content was measured through (31) P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After the intervention, the creatine group presented higher muscle phosphorylcreatine content when compared with the placebo group (+80.3% versus -2.7%; P = 0.04). Furthermore, the creatine group presented greater muscle strength than the placebo group in the leg press and chest press exercises (+9.8% and +1.2% for creatine versus -0.5% and -7.2% for placebo, respectively; P = 0.02 and P = 0.002, respectively). Isometric strength was greater in the creatine group than in the placebo group (+6.4% versus -3.2%; P = 0.007). However, no general changes were observed in aerobic conditioning, pain, cognitive function, quality of sleep, and quality of life. Food intake remained unaltered and no side effects were reported. Creatine supplementation increased intramuscular phosphorylcreatine content and improved lower- and upper-body muscle function, with minor changes in other fibromyalgia features. These findings introduce creatine supplementation as a useful dietary intervention to improve muscle function in fibromyalgia patients.",

It improves muscle performance in healthy individuals and might be helpful for treating myopathies. To evaluate the efficacy of oral creatine supplementation in muscle diseases. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register in May 2004 for randomised trials using the search term 'creatine'. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2005) using the same search term. We adapted this strategy to search MEDLINE (PubMed, from January 1966 to September 2005) and EMBASE (from January 1980 to May 2004). We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials identified, contacted the authors and known experts in the field and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data. Types of studies: randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials. people of all ages with hereditary muscle disease. Types of intervention: any creatine supplementation of at least 0.03 g/kg body weight/day. change in muscle strength measured by quantitative muscle testing. change in muscle strength measured by manual muscle testing, change in energy parameters assessed by 31 phosphorous spectroscopy, change in muscle mass or a surrogate for muscle mass, adverse events. Two authors independently applied the selection criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Some missing data were obtained from investigators. Twelve trials, including 266 participants, met the selection criteria. One trial compared creatine and glutamine treatment with placebo. In trials with 138 participants with muscular dystrophies treated with creatine, there was a significant increase in maximum voluntary contraction in the creatine group compared to placebo, with a weighted mean difference of 8.47% (95% confidence intervals 3.55 to 13.38). There was also an increase in lean body mass during creatine treatment compared to placebo (weighted mean difference 0.63 kg, 95% confidence intervals 0.02 to 1.25). No trial reported any clinically relevant adverse event. In trials with 33 participants with metabolic myopathies treated with creatine, there was no significant difference in maximum voluntary contraction between the creatine and placebo group (weighted mean difference -2.26%, confidence intervals -6.29 to 1.78). One trial reported a significant increase in muscle pain during high-dose creatine treatment (150 mg/kg body weight) in glycogen storage disease type V. Evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that short- and medium-term creatine treatment improves muscle strength in people with muscular dystrophies, and is well-tolerated. Evidence from randomised controlled trials does not show significant improvement in muscle strength in metabolic myopathies. High-dose creatine in glycogenosis type V increased muscle pain.",

However, concerns have been raised about the potential role in promoting hair loss by increasing dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Currently, there is no direct evidence examining the relationship between creatine supplementation and hair follicle health. Therefore, the purpose was to determine the effects of 12\u2009weeks of creatine supplementation on androgen levels and hair follicle health in healthy young males. Forty-five resistance-trained males (ages 18-40 years) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a creatine monohydrate (5\u2009g/day) or placebo (5\u2009g maltodextrin/day) group. Participants maintained their habitual diets and training routines. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 12\u2009weeks to measure total testosterone, free testosterone, and DHT. Hair follicle health was assessed using the Trichogram test and the FotoFinder system (hair density, follicular unit count, and cumulative hair thickness). Statistical analyses were performed using repeated measures ANOVA, and potential outliers were examined through sensitivity analysis. Thirty-eight participants completed the study, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups. There were no group-by-time interactions observed for any hormones or hair-related outcomes (\u2009>\u20090.05).

It is also an essential brain compound and some hypothesize that it aids cognition by improving energy supply and neuroprotection. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of oral creatine administration on cognitive function in healthy individuals. A search of multiple electronic databases was performed for the identification of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the cognitive effects of oral creatine supplementation in healthy individuals. Six studies (281 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Generally, there was evidence that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration. Regarding other cognitive domains, such as long-term memory, spatial memory, memory scanning, attention, executive function, response inhibition, word fluency, reaction time and mental fatigue, the results were conflicting. Performance on cognitive tasks stayed unchanged in young individuals. Vegetarians responded better than meat-eaters in memory tasks but for other cognitive domains no differences were observed. Oral creatine administration may improve short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning of healthy individuals but its effect on other cognitive domains remains unclear. Findings suggest potential benefit for aging and stressed individuals. Since creatine is safe, future studies should include larger sample sizes.

          "content": "The role of creatine supplementation in young athletes and bodybuilders is well established including ergogenic properties of muscular hypertrophy, strength, power, and endurance. Whether the benefits of creatine supplementation translate to an aging population with moderate training stimulus remains unclear especially in regard to gender, creatine dose, and duration. This systematic review assessed whether creatine supplementation combined with exercise results in additive improvements in indices of skeletal muscle, bone, and mental health over exercise alone in healthy older adults. PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were utilized to identify randomized controlled trials of creatine supplementation combined with exercise in an aging population with additional predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, and performed quality assessments using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Seventeen studies were comprehensively reviewed according to categories of strength, endurance, functional capacity, body composition, cognition, and safety. These studies suggest that any additive ergogenic creatine effects on upper and/or lower body strength, functional capacity, and lean mass in an older population would require a continuous and daily low-dose creatine supplementation combined with at least 12 weeks of resistance training. Potential creatine specific increases in regional bone mineral density of the femur are possible but may require at least 1 year of creatine supplementation combined with moderate resistance training, and additional long-term clinical trials are warranted. The limited data suggested no additive effects of creatine over exercise alone on indices of mental health. The beneficial effects of creatine supplementation are more consistent in older women than in men. Creatine monohydrate is safe to use in older adults. While creatine in conjunction with moderate- to high-intensity exercise in an aging population may improve skeletal muscle health, additional studies are needed to determine the effective dosing and duration paradigm for potential combined creatine and exercise effects on bone and cognition in older adults.",

Efficacy of alternative forms of creatine supplementation on improving performance and body composition in healthy subjects: a systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 36(9): 2663-2670, 2022-Novel forms of creatine have appeared in the marketplace with substantial claims of improved efficacy compared to creatine monohydrate (CrM). The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review on alternative forms of creatine to determine (a) whether they are effective ergogenic aids and (b) whether they outperform CrM. A separate comparison was conducted to determine average cost of various forms of creatine. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar were systematically reviewed according to PRISMA guidelines. The design of the review was set to answer the PICOS model (subjects, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design). Seventeen randomized placebo controlled clinical trials examining exercise performance outcomes and body composition were included in the analysis. Magnesium-creatine chelate and creatine citrate, malate, ethyl ester, nitrate, and pyruvate were the only forms researched in the literature. Of these studies, only 3 studies compared the alternative creatine form to CrM, making it difficult to compare efficacy to CrM. There were no consistent findings of performance enhancement among alternative forms of creatine when compared to placebo. A review of the marketplace shows that CrM is the lowest cost form of creatine. Due to the paucity of studies on alternative forms of creatine as well as high prices on the market of these alternative forms, CrM remains as the most extensively studied form of creatine that shows efficacy, safety, and lowest cost to consumer.",

          "content": "In recent years, the study of creatine supplementation in professional athletes has been of great interest. However, the genetics involved in response to supplementation is unknown. The aim of this study was to analyse, for the first time, the relationship between muscle performance-related genes and the risk of an increased body mass index (BMI) and muscle mass and a decrease in fat mass in professional football players after creatine supplementation. For this longitudinal study, one hundred and sixty-one men's professional football players were recruited. The polymorphisms  I/D,  c.1729C>T,  c.34C>T,  c.*800A>G, and  (c.49C>T and c.37885C>A) were genotyped using Single-Nucleotide Primer Extension (SNPE). To assess the combined impact of these six polymorphisms, a total genotype score (TGS) was calculated. The creatine supplementation protocol consisted of 20 g/day of creatine monohydrate for 5 days (loading dose) and 3-5 g/day for 7 weeks (maintenance dose). Anthropometric characteristics (body mass index (BMI), fat, and muscle mass) were recorded before and after the creatine supplementation protocol. Characteristics of non-contact muscle injuries during the 2022/2023 season were classified according to a consensus statement for injury recording. The results showed that the allelic frequencies of  and  differed between responders and non-responders in muscle mass increase (all  < 0.05). Players with a TGS exceeding 54.16 a.u. had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.985 (95%CI: 1.560-5.711;  = 0.001) for muscle mass increase. By contrast, those with a TGS below 54.16 a.u. had an OR of 9.385 (95%CI: 4.535-19.425;  < 0.001) for suffering non-contact muscle injuries during the season. The increase in BMI and muscle mass in response to creatine supplementation in professional football players was influenced by a TGS derived from the combination of favourable genotypes linked to muscle performance. The CC genotype and C allele of  were particularly associated with a higher likelihood of muscle mass increase under creatine supplementation in this group of professional football players.",

          "content": "The efficacy of creatine replacement through supplementation for the optimization of physical function in the population at risk of functional disability is unclear. We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from inception to November 2022. Studies included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing creatine supplementation with placebos in older adults and adults with chronic disease. The primary outcome was physical function measured by the sit-to-stand test after pooling data using random-effects modeling. We also performed a Bayesian meta-analysis to describe the treatment effect in probability terms. Secondary outcomes included other measures of physical function, muscle function, and body composition. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We identified 33 RCTs, comprising 1076 participants. From six trials reporting the primary outcome, the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-1.00; I\u2009=\u200962%; P\u2009=\u20090.04); using weakly informative priors, the posterior probability that creatine supplementation improves physical function was 66.7%. Upper-body muscle strength (SMD: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.06-0.44; I\u2009=\u20090%; P\u2009=\u20090.01), handgrip strength (SMD 0.23; 95% CI: 0.01-0.45; I\u2009=\u20090%; P\u2009=\u20090.04), and lean tissue mass (MD 1.08\u2009kg; 95% CI: 0.77-1.38; I\u2009=\u200926%; P\u2009<\u20090.01) improved with creatine supplementation. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was low or very low because of a high risk of bias. Creatine supplementation improves sit-to-stand performance, muscle function, and lean tissue mass. It is crucial to conduct high-quality prospective RCTs to confirm these hypotheses (PROSPERO number, CRD42023354929).",

The reliability and validity of the survey were assessed using SPSS software. A total of 1129 participants responded to the survey, and chi-square tests were utilized for data analysis. To explore the potential association between creatine levels (as the exposure) and renal function (as the outcome), we utilized open-access genetic databases, and Mendelian randomization (MR) techniques were used to confirm this correlation. Chi-square analysis revealed no significant association between creatine usage and renal function among the participants. Our MR analysis further supported this finding, demonstrating no significant association between creatine levels and six indicators assessing renal function (IVW, all with  values exceeding 0.05). Similar  values were consistently observed across other MR methods, confirming the absence of a statistical correlation.

Feasibility was assessed using attended study visits, completed study procedures, and adherence. Muscle function, aerobic capacity, and muscle strength were assessed with standardized exercise tests. Muscle metabolism was assessed using a 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy protocol. Fatigue, physical activity, and QOL were assessed by questionnaires. Statistical significance was estimated using a randomization (permutation) test. Changes in outcome measures taken at baseline and end-of-study were calculated using paired -tests. Median (range) adherence to the study drug was 88.5% (20.5-95.5%) and the proportion of subjects with 80% adherence or higher was 76.9%. There were no missed study visits. There were no statistically significant changes in muscle function, strength, aerobic capacity, disease activity, fatigue, physical activity, or QOL while subjects were receiving creatine compared to placebo.

          "content": "Muscle mass is important for metastatic prostate cancer survival and quality of life (QoL). The backbone of treatment for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with an androgen signaling inhibitor. ADT is an effective cancer treatment, but it facilitates significant declines in muscle mass and adverse health outcomes important to mCSPC survivors, such as fatigue, and reductions in physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, and QoL. In non-metastatic CSPC survivors, resistance training (RT) preserves muscle mass and improves these related health outcomes, but the biggest barrier to RT in CSPC survivors of all stages is fatigue. Creatine monohydrate supplementation coupled with RT (Cr\u2009+\u2009RT) may address this barrier since creatine plays a critical role in energy metabolism. Cr\u2009+\u2009RT in cancer-free older adults and other clinical populations improves muscle mass and related health outcomes. Evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation can complement cancer treatment. Thus, Cr\u2009+\u2009RT is a strategy that addresses gaps in survivorship needs of people with mCSPC. The purpose of this parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial is to test the effects of 52-weeks of Cr\u2009+\u2009RT compared with placebo (PLA) and RT (PLA\u2009+\u2009RT) on muscle mass, other related health outcomes, and markers of cancer progression. We will carry out this trial with our team's established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program in 200 mCSPC survivors receiving ADT, and evaluate outcomes at baseline, 24-, and 52-weeks. RT will occur twice weekly with elastic resistance bands, and an established creatine supplementation protocol will be used for supplementation delivery. Our approach addresses a major facilitator to RT in mCSPC survivors, a home-based RT program, while utilizing a supervised model for safety. Findings will improve delivery of comprehensive survivorship care by providing a multicomponent, patient-centered lifestyle strategy to preserve muscle mass, improve health outcomes, and complement cancer treatment (NCT06112990).",

          "content": "There is robust evidence that creatine monohydrate supplementation can enhance short-term high-intensity exercise in athletes. However, the effect of creatine monohydrate supplementation on aerobic performance and its role during aerobic activities is still controversial. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the supplementation effects of creatine monohydrate on endurance performance in a trained population. The search strategy in this systematic review and meta-analysis was designed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were explored from inception until 19 May, 2022. Only human experimental trials, controlled with a placebo group, evaluating the effects of creatine monohydrate supplementation on endurance performance in a trained population were analyzed in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. A total of 13 studies satisfied all the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The results for the pooled meta-analysis showed a non-significant change in endurance performance after creatine monohydrate supplementation in a trained population (p\u2009=\u20090.47), with a trivial negative effect (pooled standardized mean difference\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.07 [95% confidence interval\u2009-\u20090.32 to 0.18]; I\u2009=\u200934.75%). Further, after excluding the studies not evenly distributed around the base of the funnel plot, the results were similar (pooled standardized mean difference\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.07 [95% confidence interval\u2009-\u20090.27 to 0.13]; I\u2009=\u20090%; p\u2009=\u20090.49). Creatine monohydrate supplementation was shown to be ineffective on endurance performance in a trained population.

          "content": "Much attention has been given to determining the influence of total protein intake and protein source on gains in lean body mass (LBM) and strength in response to resistance exercise training (RET). Acute studies indicate that whey protein, likely related to its higher leucine content, stimulates muscle protein synthesis to a greater extent than proteins such as soy and casein. Less clear is the extent to which the type of protein supplemented impacts strength and LBM in long-term studies (\u22656 weeks). Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effect of supplementation with soy protein to animal protein supplementation on strength and LBM in response to RET. Nine studies involving 266 participants suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis were identified. Five studies compared whey with soy protein, and four studies compared soy protein with other proteins (beef, milk, or dairy protein). Meta-analysis showed that supplementing RET with whey or soy protein resulted in significant increases in strength but found no difference between groups (bench press: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.02, p\u2009=\u2009.90; squat: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.22, p\u2009=\u2009.64). There was no significant effect of whey or soy alone (n\u2009=\u20095) on LBM change and no differences between groups (\u03c7\u2009=\u20090.00, p\u2009=\u2009.96). Strength and LBM both increased significantly in the \"other protein\" and the soy groups (n\u2009=\u20099), but there were no between-group differences (bench: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.02, p\u2009=\u2009.88; squat: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.78, p\u2009=\u2009.38; and LBM: \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.06, p\u2009=\u2009.80).

Native whey has higher leucine content and thus a potentially greater anabolic effect on muscle than regular whey (WPC-80). This study compared the acute anabolic effects of ingesting 2\u2009\u00d7\u200920 g of native whey protein, WPC-80 or milk protein after a resistance exercise session. 24 young resistance trained men and women took part in this double blind, randomized, partial crossover, controlled study. Participants received either WPC-80 and native whey (\u2009=\u200910), in a crossover design, or milk (\u2009=\u200912). Supplements were ingested immediately (20\u00a0g) and two hours after (20\u00a0g) a bout of heavy-load lower body resistance exercise. Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure plasma concentrations of amino acids by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry, muscle phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting, and mixed muscle protein synthesis by use of [H]phenylalanine-infusion, gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Being the main comparison, differences between native whey and WPC-80 were analysed by a one-way ANOVA and comparisons between the whey supplements and milk were analysed by a two-way ANOVA. Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 and milk (\u2009<\u20090.05). Native whey ingestion induced a greater phosphorylation of p70S6K than milk 180\u00a0min after exercise (\u2009=\u20090.03). Muscle protein synthesis rates increased 1-3\u00a0h hours after exercise with WPC-80 (0.119%), and 1-5\u00a0h after exercise with native whey (0.112%). Muscle protein synthesis rates were higher 1-5\u00a0h after exercise with native whey than with milk (0.112% vs. 0.064, \u2009=\u20090.023). Despite higher-magnitude increases in blood leucine concentrations with native whey, it was not superior to WPC-80 concerning effect on muscle protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70S6K during a 5-h post-exercise period. Native whey increased phosphorylation of p70S6K and muscle protein synthesis rates to a greater extent than milk during the 5-h post exercise period.

After a single session of resistance type exercise, subjects were randomly allocated to one of three groups ingesting either 30 g whey protein (WHEY, n = 15), 30 g collagen protein (COLL, n = 15) or a noncaloric placebo (PLA, n = 15). Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected over a subsequent 5-h recovery period to assess both myofibrillar and muscle connective protein synthesis rates. Protein ingestion increased circulating plasma amino acid concentrations ( P < 0.05). The postprandial rise in plasma leucine and essential amino acid concentrations was greater in WHEY compared with COLL, whereas plasma glycine and proline concentrations increased more in COLL compared with WHEY ( P < 0.05). Myofibrillar protein synthesis rates averaged 0.041 \u00b1 0.010, 0.036 \u00b1 0.010, and 0.032 \u00b1 0.007%\u00b7h -1 in WHEY, COLL and PLA, respectively, with only WHEY resulting in higher rates when compared with PLA ( P < 0.05). Muscle connective protein synthesis rates averaged 0.072 \u00b1 0.019, 0.068 \u00b1 0.017, and 0.058 \u00b1 0.018%\u00b7h -1 in WHEY, COLL, and PLA, respectively, with no significant differences between groups ( P = 0.09). Ingestion of whey protein during recovery from exercise increases myofibrillar protein synthesis rates. Neither collagen nor whey protein ingestion further increased muscle connective protein synthesis rates during the early stages of postexercise recovery in both male and female recreational athletes.",

          "content": "As a relatively novel approach to enhancing skeletal muscle health, mixed protein supplementation has shown similar responses to whey protein. However, no previous studies have examined its impact on golf swing performance. This study aimed to examine the effect of mixed protein supplementation on the swing performance and muscle strength of casual golfers. Sixty participants with a handicap of less than 20 were recruited and randomly assigned to a double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. The participants were divided into two groups: a mixed protein group (MG, \u2009=\u200930), and a placebo control group (CG, \u2009=\u200930). They were instructed to ingest either a supplement containing casein calcium, whey protein, and isolated pea protein, or a placebo, once daily for 8\u2009weeks. Pre- and posttests consisted of anthropometric measurements, muscle strength (isokinetic knee and trunk strength, and handgrip strength), 2-minute push-ups, balance, and golf swing performance using a driver and 7-iron. After the 8-week supplementation period, ANCOVA, using baseline values as covariates, revealed significant differences for driver distance (\u2009=\u2009.004) and driver ball speed (\u2009<\u2009.001). MG significantly increased driver distance by 5.17\u2009\u00b1\u200912.8\u2009m (\u2009=\u2009.046), driver ball speed by 1.36\u2009\u00b1\u20092.87\u2009m/s (\u2009=\u2009.021). Additionally, significantly improvements were observed in hand grip strength (+2.12\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47\u2009kg, \u2009=\u2009.004), two-minute push-ups (+4.89\u2009\u00b1\u20098.14 reps, \u2009=\u2009.004), and balance score (-0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69\u2009min, \u2009=\u2009.009). No significant differences were observed in body composition parameters (\u2009>\u2009.05). The intake of a mixed protein containing both animal and plant proteins had positive effects on golf performance and muscle function. Therefore, mixed proteins may represent a safe and effective approach to enhancing skeletal muscle health in golf players.",

          "title": "Whey Protein Supplementation Combined with Exercise on Muscle Protein Synthesis and the AKT/mTOR Pathway in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
          "content": "The process of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) plays a pivotal role in the enhancement of muscle function. Following a bout of exercise, the rate of MPS experiences an elevation for a brief period, known as the \"anabolic window.\" Despite whey protein supplementation has been demonstrated to augment the post-exercise anabolic window, the optimal timing and dosage remain controversial. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the effects of whey protein supplementation on post-exercise MPS and its protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in healthy adults.  Following PRISMA guidelines, this review included 21 RCTs, with 15 studies subjected to meta-analysis and 6 studies to qualitative analysis. Eligible studies examined myofibrillar fractional synthetic rate (FSR) or the AKT/mTOR pathway-related protein phosphorylation levels in muscle biopsy samples.  The combination of whey protein supplementation and exercise has been shown to significantly enhance FSR (Hedge's g = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.71-1.77;  < 0.001), with increases ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 folds when consumed immediately after exercise and up to 2.5 folds when given 45 min prior to multiple-set resistance exercise. A dose-dependent increase in FSR was observed in response to whey protein supplementation, ranging from 10 to 60 g. In comparison to the placebo group, whey protein supplementation enhanced the phosphorylation levels of AKT, mTOR, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) at 1-2 h post-exercise. Phosphorylation levels of p70S6K and rpS6 decreased 4-5 h after exercise.  The combination of whey protein supplementation and exercise improves MPS in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Consumption of 20-40g of whey protein before multiple sets of resistance exercise may enhance myofibrillar FSR and activate the AKT/mTOR pathway, thereby augmenting MPS and extending the anabolic window.",

We evaluated the feasibility and effects of resistance training with and without protein supplementation on lean body mass and muscle strength among survivors. This double-blind placebo-controlled trial enrolled survivors \u226518 to <45 yr old. Participants were randomized to resistance training with protein supplement (21 g whey protein per day, 90 kcal) (RT + S) or resistance training with placebo (sucrose, 90 kcal) (RT + P). Participants received educational materials, access to a local fitness center, and a tailored resistance training program with tapered supervision. Participant retention and adherence were used to evaluate feasibility. Lean body mass and muscle strength were assessed at baseline and 24 wk, using dual x-ray absorptiometry, and dynamometer testing or one-repetition maximum testing, respectively. Mean changes were compared with two-way ANOVA. Of 70 participants randomized, 57 completed the 24-wk intervention (24 in RT + S, 33 in RT + P). The RT + S group completed 74.8% and the RT + P group completed 67.0% of exercise sessions. Mean \u00b1 SD age for those who completed was 33.1 \u00b1 7.0 yr, 67% were White and 47% female. There were no differences in change in lean mass (RT + S, 1.05 \u00b1 2.34 kg; RT + P, 0.13 \u00b1 2.19 kg; P = 0.10) or strength (grip RT + S, 1.65 \u00b1 4.17 kg; RT + P, 1.63 \u00b1 4.47 kg; P = 0.98; mean leg press RT + S, 58.4 \u00b1 78.8 kg; RT + P, 51.0 \u00b1 65.1 kg; P = 0.68) between groups. Both lean mass (P = 0.03) and strength (grip P = 0.003, leg press P < 0.001) increased over time. Supervised resistance training among survivors with protein supplementation is feasible but not more effective at increasing total lean body mass than resistance training alone.",

          "content": "Controversy exists concerning the effects of higher total protein intake (TPro) on bone health, which may be associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD). However, whey protein (WP) may induce bone formation because of its basic component, milk basic protein. This study assessed the effects of WP supplementation, TPro, and change in TPro (postsupplementation - presupplementation) on BMD and bone mineral content (BMC; total body, lumbar spine, total femur, and femoral neck) in overweight and class I obese middle-aged adults following an exercise intervention. This analysis used data from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 36-wk WP supplementation trial, wherein participants consumed a 1.7-MJ (400-kcal) supplement (0, 20, 40, or 60 g WP/d) along with their otherwise unrestricted diet while participating in a resistance and aerobic exercise intervention (3 d/wk). TPro was the summation of WP and habitual dietary intakes (4-d food record). Statistical analyses for WP were based on group and bone data [n = 186, 108 women; mean \u00b1 SD age: 49 \u00b1 8 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m): 30.1 \u00b1 2.8], whereas TPro was based on dietary and bone data (n = 113, 70 women; age 50 \u00b1 8 y; BMI 30.1 \u00b1 2.9). WP supplementation, regardless of dose, did not influence BMD or BMC following the intervention. By using a multiple linear regression model, TPro (expressed as g/d or g \u00b7 kg \u00b7 d) and change in TPro (expressed as g/d) were not associated with responses over time in total or regional BMD or BMC. By using a cluster analysis approach [<1.0 (n = 41), 1.0-1.2 (n = 28), and \u22651.2 g \u00b7 kg \u00b7 d (n = 44)], TPro was also not associated with responses in total or regional BMD or BMC over time. WP supplementation and total dietary protein intake did not negatively or beneficially influence bone quantity in overweight and obese adults during a 9-mo exercise intervention.

Twenty-four professional U23 cyclists (19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years, peak oxygen uptake: 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9\u00a0ml/kg/min) participated in a six-day training camp.

          "content": "This randomized trial compared pea protein, whey protein, and water-only supplementation on muscle damage, inflammation, delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), and physical fitness test performance during a 5-day period after a 90-min eccentric exercise bout in non-athletic non-obese males ( = 92, ages 18-55 years). The two protein sources (0.9 g protein/kg divided into three doses/day) were administered under double blind procedures. The eccentric exercise protocol induced significant muscle damage and soreness, and reduced bench press and 30-s Wingate performance. Whey protein supplementation significantly attenuated post-exercise blood levels for biomarkers of muscle damage compared to water-only, with large effect sizes for creatine kinase and myoglobin during the fourth and fifth days of recovery (Cohen's d > 0.80); pea protein versus water supplementation had an intermediate non-significant effect (Cohen's d < 0.50); and no significant differences between whey and pea protein were found. Whey and pea protein compared to water supplementation had no significant effects on post-exercise DOMS and the fitness tests. In conclusion, high intake of whey protein for 5 days after intensive eccentric exercise mitigated the efflux of muscle damage biomarkers, with the intake of pea protein having an intermediate effect.",

          "content": "This review evaluated the effects of milk-based protein supplementation on resistance training (RT)-induced gains in lean body mass or fat free mass (LBM/FFM) and muscle strength for older adults. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and EBSCOhost/SPORTDiscus was conducted. Eligibility criteria: Randomized controlled trials comparing all types of milk-based protein supplements with control supplements for the training older adults at mean age \u2265 60 y. Twenty studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, whilst seventeen studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. A dose of 10-15 g of milk protein supplementation was sufficient to augment RT-induced LBM/FFM. Intriguingly, four out of five studies show negative effect of whey protein supplementation at the same dose range (or even higher) compared with control supplementation (-0.49 kg, 95% CI: -0.69, -0.29, I = 14%, Z = 4.82,  < 0.001). For milk-based protein supplementation, RT-induced improvements in muscle strength were observed only when the protein doses \u226522 g (+0.66 kg, 95% CI: 0.07, 1.25, I = 0%, Z = 2.18,  = 0.03). Conclusion: Milk protein is superior to whey protein in enhancing RT-induced LBM/FFM gains for older adults. Optimal daily protein intake can dilute the protein supplementation effect.",

          "content": "It has been proposed that protein supplementation during resistance exercise training enhances muscle hypertrophy. The degree of hypertrophy during training is controlled in part through the activation of satellite cells and myonuclear accretion. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of protein supplementation (and the type of protein) during traditional resistance training on myofiber cross-sectional area, satellite cell content, and myonuclear addition. Healthy young men participated in supervised whole-body progressive resistance training 3 d\u00b7wk for 12 wk. Participants were randomized to one of three groups ingesting a daily 22-g macronutrient dose of soy-dairy protein blend (PB, n = 22), whey protein isolate (WP, n = 15), or an isocaloric maltodextrin placebo (MDP, n = 17). Lean mass, vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional area, satellite cell content, and myonuclear addition were assessed before and after resistance training. PB and the pooled protein treatments (PB + WP = PRO) exhibited a greater whole-body lean mass %change compared with MDP (P = 0.057 for PB) and (P = 0.050 for PRO), respectively. All treatments demonstrated similar leg muscle hypertrophy and vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional area (P < 0.05). Increases in myosin heavy chain I and II myofiber satellite cell content and myonuclei content were also detected after exercise training (P < 0.05). Protein supplementation during resistance training has a modest effect on whole-body lean mass as compared with exercise training without protein supplementation, and there was no effect on any outcome between protein supplement types (blend vs whey). However, protein supplementation did not enhance resistance exercise-induced increases in myofiber hypertrophy, satellite cell content, or myonuclear addition in young healthy men. We propose that as long as protein intake is adequate during muscle overload, the adaptations in muscle growth and function will not be influenced by protein supplementation.",

          "content": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of whey protein supplementation on myofibrillar protein synthesis (myoPS) and muscle recovery over a 7-d period of intensified resistance training (RT). In a double-blind randomised parallel group design, 16 resistance-trained men aged 18 to 35 years completed a 7-d RT protocol, consisting of three lower-body RT sessions on non-consecutive days. Participants consumed a controlled diet (146 kJ\u00b7kg\u00b7d, 1.7 g\u00b7kg\u00b7d protein) with either a whey protein supplement or an isonitrogenous control (0.33 g\u00b7kg\u00b7d protein). To measure myoPS, 400 ml of deuterium oxide (DO) (70 atom %) was ingested the day prior to starting the study and m. vastus lateralis biopsies were taken before and after RT-intervention. Myofibrillar fractional synthetic rate (myoFSR) was calculated via deuterium labelling of myofibrillar-bound alanine, measured by gas chromatography-pyrolysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-Pyr-IRMS). Muscle recovery parameters (i.e., countermovement jump height, isometric-squat force, muscle soreness and serum creatine kinase) were assessed daily. MyoFSR PRE was 1.6 (0.2) %\u2219d (mean (SD)). Whey protein supplementation had no effect on myoFSR ( = 0.771) or any recovery parameter ( = 0.390-0.989). Over an intense 7-d RT protocol, 0.33 g\u00b7kg\u00b7d of supplemental whey protein does not enhance day-to-day measures of myoPS or postexercise recovery in resistance-trained men.",

A 12-month randomized controlled double blind trial with a 43-month of post-trial follow-up. Porvoo, Finland. A total of 218 older (>74\u00a0years of age) community-dwelling people with sarcopenia. (1) Control with no supplementation; (2) isocaloric placebo; and (3) 20\u00a0g\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 whey-enriched protein supplementation. All participants were given instructions on home-based exercise, dietary protein, and vitamin D supplementation of 20\u00a0\u03bcg/d. Physical performance was assessed by short physical performance battery and continuous summary physical performance scores. Hand grip strength and calf intracellular resistance based skeletal muscle index were measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy. The measurements were performed at 0, 6, and 12\u00a0months. The post-trial follow-up was performed by a postal questionnaire and national census record data. The participants were older (75-96\u00a0years of age) and mostly women (68%). The test supplements had no significant effects on physical performance; the 12-month changes for short physical performance battery were\u00a0-0.55,\u00a0-.05, and 0.03 points in control, isocaloric, and protein groups (P\u00a0=\u00a0.17), respectively. The changes in continuous summary physical performance scores were similar between the intervention groups (P\u00a0=\u00a0.76). The hand grip strength decreased significantly in all intervention groups, and the 12-month changes in calf intracellular resistance-based skeletal muscle index were minor and there were no differences between the intervention groups. One-half of the patients (56%) in both supplement groups reported mild gastrointestinal adverse effects. Differences were found neither in the all-cause mortality nor physical functioning in the post-trial follow-up. The whey-enriched protein supplementation in combination with low intensity home-based physical exercise did not attenuate the deterioration of muscle and physical performance in community-dwelling older people with sarcopenia.",

The genetic variation of a specific gene, human cytochrome P450 enzyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) (rs762551), may be one reason for this difference. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the influence of CYP1A2 gene types on athletes' exercise performance after caffeine intake. A literature search through 4 databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) was conducted until March 2023. The effect size was expressed as the weighted mean difference (WMD) by calculating fixed effects meta-analysis if heterogeneity was not significant (I \u2264 50% and p \u2265 0.1). Subgroup analyses were performed based on AA and AC/CC genotype of CYP1A2. The final number of studies meeting the inclusion criteria was 12 (n\u202f=\u202f666 participants). The overall analysis showed that the cycling time trial significantly improved after caffeine intake (WMD\u202f=\u202f-0.48, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): -0.83 to -0.13, p\u202f=\u202f0.007).

Caffeine supplementation did not influence the Wingate (WMD\u202f=\u202f8.07, 95%CI: -22.04 to 38.18, p\u202f=\u202f0.60) or countermovement jump test (CMJ) performance (WMD\u202f=\u202f1.17, 95%CI: -0.02 to 2.36, p\u202f=\u202f0.05), and these outcomes were not influenced by CYP1A2 genotype. Participants with the CYP1A2 genotype with A allele improved their cycling time trials after caffeine supplementation. However, compared to placebo, acute caffeine supplementation failed to increase the Wingate or CMJ performance, regardless of CYP1A2 genotype.",

          "content": "Caffeine, identified as a central nervous system stimulant in foods, beverages (coffee, tea, chocolate), and medications, has been focused on its ergogenic properties, enhancing physical performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the caffeine intake (from coffee) and fat-free mass index (FFMI). We carried out a cohort study that included 3,466 women and 3,145 men aged \u226520\u2009years who were intaking caffeine. Caffeine intake from coffee were obtained from two 24-hour dietary recall interviews. The FFMI was calculated as FFM (kg) divided by height in m. The caffeine intake was classified into quartiles and combined into 4 groups. Multiple linear regression model analysis and multiple logistic regression model analysis were used to assess associations between the caffeine and FFMI adjusted for potential confounders. Among the 2,427 participants, males accounted for 52.4%, and females 47.6%. In multiple linear regression model, Model 1 (unadjusted Model (\u2009=\u20090.041)) and Model 2 (adjusted for age, race, and BMI (\u2009=\u20090.006)) in women showed a significant relationship between caffeine intake and FFMI. In multivariable models, caffeine intake and FFMI were significantly different (\u2009<\u20090.05). In sex subgroups, among females, each quartile of caffeine intake was positively correlated with FFMI levels in the average FFMI group in Model 3 (\u2009<\u20090.001). In age subgroups, each quartile of caffeine intake was positively correlated with FFMI levels in the average FFMI group in Model 3 for individuals aged 20-40 (\u2009=\u20090.039) and those aged above 40 (\u2009=\u20090.016). In drinking status subgroups, if they drunk alcohol, each quartile was positively correlated with FFMI levels in the average FFMI group in Model 3 (\u2009<\u20090.001). Caffeine intake was mainly positively associated with FFMI, especially in women with above levels of FFMI. Longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to establish causality and provide evidence-based recommendations regarding caffeine intake to optimize muscle health.",

          "content": "Acute caffeine intake has been found to increase working memory (WM)-related brain activity in healthy adults without improving behavioral\u00a0performances. The impact of daily caffeine intake-a ritual shared by 80% of the population worldwide-and of its discontinuation on working memory and its neural correlates remained unknown. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, we examined working memory functions in 20 young healthy non-smokers (age: 26.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0\u00a0years; body mass index: 22.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u00a0kg/m; and habitual caffeine intake: 474.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009107.5\u00a0mg/day) in a 10-day caffeine (150\u00a0mg\u2009\u00d7\u20093 times/day), a 10-day placebo (3 times/day), and a withdrawal condition (9-day caffeine followed by 1-day placebo). Throughout the 10th day of each condition, participants performed four times a working memory task (N-Back, comprising 3- and 0-back), and task-related blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity was measured in the last session with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to placebo, participants showed a higher error rate and a longer reaction time in 3- against 0-back trials in the caffeine condition; also, in the withdrawal condition we observed a higher error rate compared to placebo. However, task-related BOLD activity, i.e., an increased attention network and decreased default mode network activity in 3- versus 0-back, did not show significant differences among three conditions. Interestingly, irrespective of 3- or 0-back, BOLD activity was reduced in the right hippocampus in the caffeine condition compared to placebo. Adding to the earlier evidence showing increasing cerebral metabolic demands for WM function after acute caffeine intake, our data suggest that such demands might be impeded over daily intake and therefore result in a worse performance. Finally, the reduced hippocampal activity may reflect caffeine-associated hippocampal grey matter plasticity reported in the previous analysis. The findings of this study reveal an adapted neurocognitive response to daily caffeine exposure and highlight the importance of classifying impacts of caffeine on clinical and healthy populations.",

          "content": "The aim was to quantify the proportion of the literature on caffeine supplementation that reports habitual caffeine consumption, and determine the influence of habitual consumption on the acute exercise response to caffeine supplementation, using a systematic review and meta-analytic approach. Three databases were searched, and articles screened according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Three-level meta-analyses and meta-regression models were used to investigate the influence of habitual caffeine consumption on caffeine's overall ergogenic effect and within different exercise types (endurance, power, strength), in men and women, and in trained and untrained individuals. Sub-analyses were performed according to the following: acute relative dose (<\u20093, 3-6, >\u20096\u00a0mg/kg body mass [BM]); whether the acute caffeine dose provided was lower or higher than the mean daily caffeine dose; and the caffeine withdrawal period prior to the intervention (<\u200924, 24-48, >\u200948\u00a0h). Sixty caffeine studies included sufficient information on habitual consumption to be included in the meta-analysis. A positive overall effect of caffeine was shown in comparison to placebo (standard mean difference [SMD]\u2009=\u20090.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.30; p\u2009<\u20090.001) with no influence of relative habitual caffeine consumption (p\u2009=\u20090.59). Subgroup analyses showed a significant ergogenic effect when the caffeine dose was\u2009<\u20093\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.40; p\u2009=\u20090.003) and 3-6\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.21-0.32; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), but not\u2009>\u20096\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.11, 95% CI\u2009-\u20090.07 to 0.30; p\u2009=\u20090.23); when the dose was both higher (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.20-0.31; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and lower (SMD\u2009=\u20090.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.36; p\u2009=\u20090.006) than the habitual caffeine dose; and when withdrawal was\u2009<\u200924\u00a0h, 24-48\u00a0h, and\u2009>\u200948\u00a0h. Caffeine was effective for endurance, power, and strength exercise, with no influence (all p\u2009\u2265\u20090.23) of relative habitual caffeine consumption within exercise types.

The high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) and internal standards labeled with stable isotopes were used to measure urinary caffeine and fourteen of its metabolites. Urinary caffeine and its metabolites levels were calibrated with urine creatinine for analysis. Caffeine and its metabolites were analyzed as continuous variables and categorical variables (\u2264\u200950% or >\u200950%). Weighted logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analysis by sex was conducted.

Caffeine increased cycling endurance by 25% [95% confidence interval (CI): 13-38; P = 0.0001] and isometric arm flexion endurance by 54% (95% CI: 29-83; P = 0.0001). Caffeine also reduced the rating of perceived exertion after 5 min of cycling by 11% (95% CI: 5-17; P = 0.002) and postural stability with eyes open by 25% (95% CI: 2-53; P = 0.03). Caffeine ingestion did not affect muscle strength, walking speed, reaction, and movement times. At the end of the study, 46% of participants correctly identified when they received caffeine and placebo. Caffeine increased exercise endurance in healthy citizens aged > or =70 yr, but the participants' reasons for stopping the test may have varied between subjects, as the cycling test was done at approximately 55% of maximal oxygen consumption. Further studies are required to investigate whether caffeine can be utilized to improve the physical performance of elderly citizens.",

          "content": "To investigate the relations between caffeine-derived metabolites (methylxanthines) and plasma lipids by use of population-based data from 2 European countries. Families were randomly selected from the general population of northern Belgium (FLEMENGHO), from August 12, 1985, until November 22, 1990, and 3 Swiss cities (SKIPOGH), from November 25, 2009, through April 4, 2013. We measured plasma concentrations (FLEMENGHO, SKIPOGH) and 24-hour urinary excretions (SKIPOGH) of 4 methylxanthines-caffeine, paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline-using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We used enzymatic methods to estimate total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and the Friedewald equation for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in plasma. We applied sex-specific mixed models to investigate associations between methylxanthines and plasma lipids, adjusting for major confounders. In both FLEMENGHO (N=1987; 1055 [53%] female participants) and SKIPOGH (N=990; 523 [53%] female participants), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels increased across quartiles of plasma caffeine, paraxanthine, and theophylline (total cholesterol levels by caffeine quartiles in FLEMENGHO, male participants: 5.01\u00b10.06 mmol/L, 5.05\u00b10.06 mmol/L, 5.27\u00b10.06 mmol/L, 5.62\u00b10.06 mmol/L; female participants: 5.24\u00b10.06 mmol/L, 5.15\u00b10.05 mmol/L, 5.25\u00b10.05 mmol/L, 5.42\u00b10.05 mmol/L). Similar results were observed using urinary methylxanthines in SKIPOGH (total cholesterol levels by caffeine quartiles, male participants: 4.54\u00b10.08 mmol/L, 4.94\u00b10.08 mmol/L, 4.87\u00b10.08 mmol/L, 5.27\u00b10.09 mmol/L; female participants: 5.12\u00b10.07 mmol/L, 5.21\u00b10.07 mmol/L, 5.28\u00b10.05 mmol/L, 5.28\u00b10.07 mmol/L). Furthermore, urinary caffeine and theophylline were positively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in SKIPOGH male participants. Plasma and urinary caffeine, paraxanthine, and theophylline were positively associated with plasma lipids, whereas the associations involving theobromine were less clear. We postulate that the positive association between caffeine intake and plasma lipids may be related to the sympathomimetic function of methylxanthines, mitigating the overall health-beneficial effect of caffeine intake.",

          "content": "Caffeine, widely recognized as an ergogenic aid, has undergone extensive research, demonstrating its effectiveness to enhance endurance performance. However, there remains a significant gap in systematically evaluating its effects on time trial (TT) performance in cyclists. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the efficacy of caffeine ingestion to increase cycling TT performance in cyclists and to evaluate the optimal dosage range for maximum effect. A search of four databases was completed on 1 December 2023. The selected studies comprised crossover, placebo-controlled investigations into the effects of caffeine ingestion on cycling TT performance. Completion time (Time) and mean power output (MPO) were used as performance measures for TT. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model to assess the standardized mean differences (SMD) in individual studies. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analyses. Subgroup analysis showed that moderate doses of caffeine intake (4-6\u2009mg/kg) significantly improved cycling performance (SMD \u2009=\u2009-0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u2009-0.84\u2009~\u2009-0.26, \u2009<\u20090.01, \u2009=\u200935%; SMD \u2009=\u20090.44, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.09\u2009~\u20090.79, \u2009<\u20090.05, \u2009=\u200939%), while the effects of low doses (1-3\u2009mg/kg) of caffeine were not significant (SMD \u2009=\u2009-0.34, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.84\u2009~\u20090.17, \u2009=\u20090.19, \u2009=\u20090%; SMD \u2009=\u20090.31, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.02\u2009~\u20090.65, \u2009=\u20090.07, \u2009=\u20090%). A moderate dosage (4-6\u2009mg/kg) of caffeine, identified as the optimal dose range, can significantly improve the time trial performance of cyclists, while a low dose (1-3\u2009mg/kg) does not yield improvement. In addition, the improvements in completion time and mean power output resulting from a moderate dose of caffeine are essentially the same in cycling time trails.",

Systematic searches through the PubMed, VHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Peer-reviewed articles written in English that reported the prevalence/percentage or magnitude/effect size of side effects after caffeine supplementation in athletes in a sports context were included. Studies were grouped by the dose of caffeine administered as follows: low\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2264\u20093.0\u00a0mg/kg; moderate\u2009=\u2009from 3.1 to 6.0\u00a0mg/kg; high\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2265\u20096.1\u00a0mg/kg. The magnitude of the side effects was calculated with effect sizes. The search retrieved 25 studies that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria with a pooled sample of 421 participants. The supplementation with caffeine produced a higher prevalence or magnitude of all side effects under investigation when compared to placebo/control situations. The prevalence (magnitude) was between 6 and 34% (ES between 0.13 and 1.11) for low doses of caffeine, between 0 and 34% (ES between -0.13 and 1.20) for moderate doses of caffeine, and between 8 and 83% (ES between 0.04 and 1.52) with high doses of caffeine. The presence of tachycardia/heart palpitations and the negative effects on sleep onset had the highest prevalence and magnitude, in athletes using supplementation with caffeine. In summary, caffeine supplementation in the doses habitually used to enhance physical performance produces several side effects, both after exercise and at least 24\u00a0h after the ingestion. However, the prevalence and magnitude of side effects with high doses of caffeine were habitually higher than with low doses of caffeine. From a practical perspective, using\u2009~3.0\u00a0mg/kg of caffeine may be the dose of choice to obtain the ergogenic benefits of caffeine with the lowest prevalence and magnitude of side effects.",

A systematic search of randomized controlled trials (PROSPERO: CRD42024505377) was performed from 1980 to December 2023 through Web of Science (ISI), Cinahl, Embase, CENTRAL, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Scienceopen. The effect of caffeine supplement on all sleep parameters (e.g. duration, quality, insomnia), assessed through objective and subjective methods, was investigated among the athletic community. Of 1469 records, nine trials were eligible for the current review. The studies showed varying results concerning sleep quality, quantity, efficiency, number of awakenings, sleep onset latency, and other sleep-related variables. These differences in findings may be attributable to factors such as the timing of caffeine consumption in relation to sleep time and the time of exercise, habitual caffeine use, and the dose of caffeine prescribed. Given the nature of caffeine, insomnia following ingestion is likely to occur. This review explores the mechanisms by which caffeine influences sleep in athletes. While caffeine supplementation may enhance athletic performance, it could have a detrimental effect on sleep and therefore recovery. It is important that supplementation considers individual responses to caffeine so that it does not adversely affect sleep in this population. CRD42024505377.",

As many know, chronic use of caffeine leads to dependence, tolerance, drug craving, and upon abrupt cessation unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Thus, caffeine fulfills pharmacological criteria by which agents are classified as drugs of abuse. Nevertheless, its use is legal and only at high, but readily attainable, levels is it banned from sport. Its use is widespread by athletes as young as 11 years of age who are seeking athletic advantage over fellow competitors. It is likely that its use will not decline any time soon because it is inexpensive, readily available, medically quite safe, socially acceptable, and by most measures legal. However, at levels allowed in sport, caffeine through its wide-ranging physiological and psychological effects increases endurance in well-trained athletes. If the goal of drug-testing and education programs in sport is to protect the health of athletes, prevent unfair advantage (cheating) and encourage ethical behavior then it seems obvious that the allowable levels of caffeine ingestion should be decreased. The alternative is to continue with policies designed largely to punish only those that get caught.",

          "content": "Most studies assessing the association between coffee consumption and hypertension ascertained caffeine intake in terms of number of cups per days, and yield mixed results. Although the inter-individuals variability in the caffeine metabolism is known, the relation of caffeine metabolites with hypertension remains unsettled. We examined the association of caffeine and 13 direct and indirect caffeine metabolites with hypertension in U.S. adults. Using data from 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we included 2278 individuals aged 18 to 80 years. Urinary methyluric acids (MU) and methylxanthines (MX) products of caffeine metabolism were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. We used multivariate logistic regression to model hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265130\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u226580\u2009mmHg) as functions of urinary coffee metabolites. The odds of hypertension decreased across quartiles of 3-MU, 7-MU, 3-MX and 7-MX, with 7-MU being the more powerful metabolite. Compared with adults in the bottom quartile of 7-MU, the odds of hypertension decreased by 81% (95% CI: -90 to -22%) in those in the upper quartile. In contrast, the odds ratio for being hypertensive from the bottom to the upper quartile were 4.47 (95% CI: 1.21-16.50) for 1,3-dimethyluric acid, 4.45 (95% CI: 1.48-13.39) for 1,3-dimethylxanthine, and 5.08 (95% CI: 1.11-23.36) for 1,7-dimethylxanthine. Neither insulin resistance nor abdominal obesity were moderators in these associations. Final metabolites of caffeine (namely 3-MU, 7-MU, 3-MX and 7-MX), but not caffeine, significantly reduce the odds for hypertension in this population.",

This randomized, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of combined versus single supplementation of creatine (Cr), beta-alanine (BA), and L-citrulline (L-Cit) during short sprint interval training (SSIT)\u00a0on basketball players' physical and physiological performance over a period of 28\u00a0days. Forty-eight basketball players were equally assigned to 6 groups of Cr (0.1\u00a0g/kg of Cr monohydrate daily), BA (4.8\u00a0g daily), L-Cit (6\u00a0g daily), combined supplementation, PL, and an active control group, and each group consisted of 8 participants. The training groups participated in SSIT (3 sets of 10 repetitions of 5-s all-out runs) sessions 3 times a week for 4\u00a0weeks. Physical (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Illinois change of direction) and physiological (Wingate anaerobic power and cardiorespiratory fitness test) performance were evaluated before and after the training period. All training groups (Cr, BA, L-Cit, combined, and PL) showed significant improvements in physical and physiological performance over the 4-week intervention (P < .05). Interestingly, the supplement groups displayed significantly (P = .001) greater changes than the PL group, indicating better outcomes in performance adaptations. However, significant differences in performance variables were observed among the supplement groups. Our findings indicate that short-term supplementation with Cr, BA, and L-Cit, as well as a combination of them during SSIT, can significantly improve the physical and physiological performance of basketball players compared to a PL.",

          "content": "Water polo (WP) is a high-intensity team sport that requires a combination of physical endurance, muscular strength, speed, and specific technical skills. Due to the demanding and prolonged nature of this sport, adequate and balanced nutrition plays a fundamental role in athletes' performance, recovery, and overall health maintenance. We aimed to compile all available information on the importance of ergonutrition and supplementation in the recovery of WP players. This will help in understanding this sport's specific challenges and requirements, enabling players and coaches to design more effective recovery plans to optimize performance, achieve goals, and successfully cope with intense training and competition. English-language publications were searched in databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO Citation Index, Medline (PubMed), KCI Korean Journal Database, and Current Contents Connect using a series of keywords such as WP, nutrition, recovery, and ergogenic aids individually or in combination. In the field of ergonutritional recovery in WP, certain supplements such as whey protein, beta-alanine, L-arginine, spirulina, and copper can be beneficial for improving performance and recovery. In some cases, WP athletes may consider using ergogenic supplements to further improve their performance and recovery process. However, it is important to bear in mind that any supplement should be carefully evaluated under the supervision of a health professional or a sports nutritionist, as some supplements may present side effects or unwanted interactions. Adequate ergogenic nutrition adapted to the needs of WP players is essential not only to optimize their athletic performance but also to ensure effective recovery and maintain their long-term health and general well-being. The application of these strategies should be evidence-based and tailored to the individual needs of the players and the specific demands of the sport. Future experimental research that can confirm our results is essential.",

          "content": "Warfighters, often called tactical athletes, seek dietary supplementation to enhance training and recovery. Roughly 69% of active-duty US military personnel have reported consuming dietary supplements. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the impact of dietary supplements on muscle-related physical performance and recovery in active-duty military personnel. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental controlled trials of oral dietary supplementation in active-duty military members were examined. A protocol was registered (PROSPERO CRD42023401472), and a systematic search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was undertaken. Inclusion criteria consisted of studies published between 1990-2023 with outcomes of muscle performance and recovery among active-duty military populations. The risk of bias was assessed with the McMaster University Guidelines and Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies. Sixteen studies were included. Four were conducted on protein or carbohydrate; four on beta-alanine alone, creatine alone, or in combination; two on mixed nutritional supplements; two on probiotics alone or in combination with beta hydroxy-beta methylbutyrate calcium; and four on phytonutrient extracts including oregano, beetroot juice, quercetin, and resveratrol. Ten examined outcomes related to physical performance, and six on outcomes of injury or recovery. Overall, protein, carbohydrate, beta-alanine, creatine, and beetroot juice modestly improved performance, while quercetin did not. Protein, carbohydrates, beta-alanine, probiotics, and oregano reduced markers of inflammation, while resveratrol did not. Nutrition supplementation may have small benefits on muscle performance and recovery in warfighters. However, there are significant limitations in interpretation due to the largely inconsistent evidence of ingredients and comparable outcomes. Thus, there is inadequate practical evidence to suggest how dietary supplementation may affect field performance.",

          "content": "Beta-alanine is a nonessential amino acid that is commonly used to improve exercise performance. It could influence the buffering of hydrogen ions produced during intense exercise and delay fatigue, providing a substrate for increased synthesis of intramuscular carnosine. This systematic review evaluates the effects of beta-alanine supplementation on maximal intensity exercise in trained, young, male individuals. Six databases were searched on August 10, 2023, to identify randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effect of chronic beta-alanine supplementation in trained male individuals with an age range of 18-40\u00a0years. Studies evaluating exercise performance through maximal or supramaximal intensity efforts falling within the 0.5-10\u00a0min duration were included. A total of 18 individual studies were analyzed, employing 18 exercise test protocols and 15 outcome measures in 331 participants. A significant (p = .01) result was observed with an overall effect size of 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.09, 0.69]), in favor of beta-alanine supplementation versus placebo. Results indicate significant effects at 4\u00a0weeks of supplementation, effect size 0.34 (95% CI [0.02, 0.67], p = .04); 4-10\u00a0min of maximal effort, effect size 0.55 (95% CI [0.07, 1.04], p = .03); and a high beta-alanine dosage of 5.6-6.4\u00a0g per day, effect size 0.35 (95% CI [0.09, 0.62], p = .009). The results provide insights into which exercise modality will benefit the most, and which dosage protocols and durations stand to provide the greatest ergogenic effects. This may be used to inform further research, and professional or recreational training design, and optimization of supplementation strategies.",

Thus, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the effects in the existing literature of EAs used by female athletes on performance. A literature research was conducted, and a descriptive analysis of the articles included in the systematic review was carried out. Meta-analyses could be performed on 32 of the included articles, evaluating performance in strength, sprint, and cardiovascular capacity. A random-effects model and the standardized mean differences (SMD) \u00b1 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. The results showed that caffeine helped to improve jumping performance, isometric strength values, and the number of repetitions until failure. Caffeine and sodium phosphate helped to improve sprint performance. Aerobic tests could be improved with the use of taurine, caffeine, and beta-alanine. No conclusive effects of beetroot juice, polyphenols, or creatine in improving aerobic performance were shown. In terms of anaerobic variables, both caffeine and sodium phosphate could help to improve repeated sprint ability. More studies are needed in female athletes that measure the effects of different EAs on sports performance, such as beetroot juice, beta-alanine or sodium phosphate, as the studies to date are scarce and there are many types of EA that need to be further considered in this population, such as creatine and taurine.",

Therefore, \u03b2-alanine could be considered a nutritional ergogenic aid to improve sports performance in combat athletes. We aimed to critically review clinical trial evidence on the impact of \u03b2-alanine supplementation on sports performance, perception, and anthropometric parameters, as well as circulating biochemical markers in combat athletes. This systematic review was conducted following the specific methodological guidelines of the Preferred Report Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA), the PICOS question model, the Critical Review Form of McMaster, and the PEDro scale. Furthermore, the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool was used. The search was carried out in the SCOPUS, Web of Science (WOS), and Medline (PubMed) databases for studies published from the beginning of the database until July 31, 2023. Of the 41 registers identified, only 7 met the established criteria and were included in this systematic review. Overall, performance parameters related to strength, power, total exercise work capacity, and combat-specific parameters were significantly improved ( < 0.05). Perception parameters increased non-significantly ( > 0.05). Regarding biochemical parameters, carnosine increased significantly ( < 0.05), pH decreased non-significantly ( > 0.05), and the results for blood bicarbonate and blood lactate were heterogeneous. Finally, there was a non-significant ( > 0.05) improvement in the anthropometric parameters of lean mass and fat mass. \u03b2-alanine supplementation appears to be safe and could be a suitable nutritional ergogenic aid for combat athletes.",

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyze the effects of BA supplementation on physical performance in aerobic-anaerobic transition zones. At the same time, the effect of different dosages and durations of BA supplementation were identified. The search was designed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses and performed in Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, SPORTDiscus, PubMed, and MEDLINE between 2010 and 2020. The methodological quality and risk of bias were evaluated with the Cochrane Collaboration tool. The main variables were the Time Trial Test (TTT) and Time to Exhaustion (TTE) tests, the latter separated into the Limited Time Test (LTT) and Limited Distance Test (LDT). The analysis was carried out with a pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) through Hedges' g test (95% CI). Nineteen studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, revealing a small effect for time in the TTT (SMD, -0.36; 95% CI, -0.87-0.16; I = 59%;  = 0.010), a small effect for LTT (SMD, 0.25; 95% CI, -0.01-0.51; I = 0%;  = 0.53), and a large effect for LDT (SMD, 4.27; 95% CI, -0.25-8.79; I = 94%;  = 0.00001). BA supplementation showed small effects on physical performance in aerobic-anaerobic transition zones.

          "content": "Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation increases muscle carnosine, an abundant endogenous antioxidant and pH buffer in skeletal muscle. Carnosine loading promotes exercise capacity in healthy older adults. As patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suffer from elevated exercise-induced muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress and acidosis, and from reduced muscle carnosine stores, it was investigated whether BA supplementation augments muscle carnosine and induces beneficial changes in exercise capacity, quadriceps function, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress in patients with COPD. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo (PL)-controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02770417), 40 patients (75% male) with COPD (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation: age 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0years; FEV % predicted 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014%) were assigned to 12\u00a0weeks oral BA or PL supplementation (3.2\u00a0g/day). The primary outcome, i.e. muscle carnosine, was quantified from m. vastus lateralis biopsies obtained before and after intervention. Co-primary outcomes, i.e. incremental and constant work rate cycle capacity, were also assessed. Linear mixed model analyses were performed. Compliance with and side effects of supplement intake and secondary outcomes (quadriceps strength and endurance, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress) were also assessed. Beta-alanine supplementation increased muscle carnosine in comparison with PL in patients with COPD (mean difference [95% confidence interval]; +2.82 [1.49-4.14] mmol/kg wet weight; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Maximal incremental cycling capacity (VO peak: +0.5 [-0.7 to 1.7] mL/kg/min; P\u00a0=\u00a00.384, Wpeak: +5 [-1 to 11] W; P\u00a0=\u00a00.103) and time to exhaustion on the constant work rate cycle test (+28 [-179 to 236] s; P\u00a0=\u00a00.782) did not change significantly. Compliance with supplement intake was similar in BA (median (quartile 1-quartile 3); 100 (98-100)%) and PL (98 (96-100)%) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.294) groups, and patients did not report side effects possibly related to supplement intake. No change was observed in secondary outcomes. Beta-alanine supplementation is efficacious in augmenting muscle carnosine (+54% from mean baseline value) without side effects\u00a0in patients with COPD in comparison with PL. However, accompanied beneficial changes in exercise capacity, quadriceps function, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress were not observed.",

          "content": "Exercise intolerance is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and, although multifactorial, it is largely caused by lower-limb muscle dysfunction. Research has shown that patients with severe to very severe COPD have significantly lower levels of muscle carnosine, which acts as a pH buffer and antioxidant. Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation has been shown to consistently elevate muscle carnosine in a variety of populations and may therefore improve exercise tolerance and lower-limb muscle function. The primary objective of the current studies is to assess the beneficial effects of BA supplementation in enhancing exercise tolerance on top of two types of exercise training (non-linear periodised exercise (NLPE) training or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)) in patients with COPD. Two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have been designed. Patients will routinely receive either NLPE (BASE-TRAIN trial) or NMES (BASE-ELECTRIC trial) as part of standard exercise-based care during their 8-to-10 week pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme. A total of 222 patients with COPD (2\u00d777 = 154 patients in the BASE-TRAIN trial and 2\u00d734 = 68 patients in the BASE-ELECTRIC trial) will be recruited from two specialised PR centres in The Netherlands. For study purposes, patients will receive 3.2 g of oral BA supplementation or placebo per day. Exercise tolerance is the primary outcome, which will be assessed using the endurance shuttle walk test (BASE-TRAIN) or the constant work rate cycle test (BASE-ELECTRIC). Furthermore, quadriceps muscle strength and endurance, cognitive function, carnosine levels (in muscle), BA levels (in blood and muscle), markers of oxidative stress and inflammation (in blood, muscles and lungs), physical activity and quality of life will be measured. Both trials were approved by CMO Regio Arnhem-Nijmegen, The Netherlands (NL70781.091.19. and NL68757.091.19). NTR8427 (BASE-TRAIN) and NTR8419 (BASE-ELECTRIC).",

          "content": "Beta-alanine, caffeine, and nitrate are dietary supplements generally recognized by the sport and exercise science community as evidence-based ergogenic performance aids. Evidence supporting the efficacy of these supplements, however, is greatly skewed due to research being conducted primarily in men. The physiological differences between men and women, most notably in sex hormones and menstrual cycle fluctuations, make generalizing male data to the female athlete inappropriate, and potentially harmful to women. This narrative review outlines the studies conducted in women regarding the efficacy of beta-alanine, caffeine, and nitrate supplementation for performance enhancement. Only nine studies on beta-alanine, 15 on caffeine, and 10 on nitrate in healthy women under the age of 40\u00a0years conducted in normoxia conditions were identified as relevant to this research question. Evidence suggests that beta-alanine may lower the rate of perceived exertion and extend training bouts in women, leading to greater functional adaptations. Studies of caffeine in women suggest the physiological responder status and caffeine habituation may contribute to caffeine's efficacy, with a potential plateau in the dose-response relationship of performance enhancement. Nitrate appears to vary in influence based on activity type and primary muscle group examined. However, the results summarized in the limited literature for each of these three supplements provide no consensus on dosage, timing, or efficacy for women. Furthermore, the literature lacks considerations for hormonal status and its role in metabolism. This gap in sex-based knowledge necessitates further research on these ergogenic supplements in women with greater considerations for the effects of hormonal status.",

Pooled effect size from 20 studies indicated that beta-alanine supplementation has no effect on body mass (WMD: -0.15 kg; 95% CI: -0.78 to 0.47;  =\u00a00.631, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.998), fat mass (FM) (WMD: -0.24 kg; 95% CI: -1.16 to 0.68;  =\u00a00.612, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.969), body fat percentage (BFP) (WMD: -0.06%; 95% CI: -0.53 to 0.40;  =\u00a00.782, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.936), and fat-free mass (FFM) (WMD: 0.05 kg; 95% CI: -0.71 to 0.82;  =\u00a00.889, I\u00a0=\u00a00.0%,  =\u00a00.912). Subgroup analyses based on exercise type (resistance training [RT], endurance training [ET], and combined training [CT]), study duration (<8 and \u22658\u00a0weeks), and beta-alanine dosage (<6 and \u22656\u00a0g/d) demonstrated similar results. Certainty of evidence across outcomes ranged from low to moderate. This meta-analysis study suggests that beta-alanine supplementation is unlikely to improve body composition indices regardless of supplementation dosage and its combination with exercise training. No studies have examined the effect of beta-alanine combined with both diet and exercise on body composition changes as the primary variable. Therefore, future studies examining the effect of the combination of beta-alanine supplementation with a hypocaloric diet and exercise programs are warranted.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of \u03b2-alanine supplementation on high-intensity running performance and critical velocity (CV) and anaerobic running capacity (ARC). Fifty recreationally trained men were randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to a \u03b2-alanine group (BA, 2 \u00d7 800 mg tablets, 3 times daily; CarnoSyn; n = 26) or placebo group (PL, 2 \u00d7 800 mg maltodextrin tablets, 3 times daily; n = 24). A graded exercise test (GXT) was performed to establish peak velocity (PV). Three high-speed runs to exhaustion were performed at 110, 100, and 90% of PV, with 15 minutes of rest between bouts. The distances achieved were plotted over the time to exhaustion (TTE). Linear regression was used to determine the slope (CV) and y-intercept (ARC) of these relationships to assess aerobic and anaerobic performances, respectively. There were no significant treatment effects (p > 0.05) on CV or ARC for either men or women. Additionally, no TTE effects were evident for bouts at 90-110%PV lasting 1.95-5.06 minutes. There seems to be no ergogenic effect of \u03b2-alanine supplementation on CV, ARC, or high-intensity running lasting approximately 2-5 minutes in either men or women in the current study.",

          "content": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of a high-dose beta-alanine (BA) supplementation on physical performance, blood lactate concentration, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) in trained futsal players. Sixteen trained futsal players participated in a randomized, parallel, double-blind experiment, completing a two-week supplementation period with either 12 g/day of BA (\u2009=\u20098; age: 19\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009years; height: 1.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u2009m; body mass: 68.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4\u2009kg) or a placebo (PLA) (\u2009=\u20098; age: 18\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009years; height: 1.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u2009m; body mass: 65.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u2009kg). Athletes completed the futsal intermittent endurance test (FIET) and a 30-m speed test before and after supplementation. Plasma lactate levels were measured before, immediately after, and three minutes post-FIET, while RPE was assessed during each FIET stage. There was a significant main effect of time for distance covered in the FIET (Pre-BA: 1618.13\u2009\u00b1\u2009268.14\u2009m; Post-BA: 1857.50\u2009\u00b1\u2009277.81\u2009m; Pre-PLA: 1519.13\u2009\u00b1\u2009243.19\u2009m; Post-PLA: 1621.88\u2009\u00b1\u2009323.65\u2009m; \u2009=\u20090.003; \u03b7p \u2009=\u20090.73), while no significant interaction effect was revealed for FIET (\u2009=\u20090.147; \u03b7p \u2009=\u20090.27). Furthermore, no significant interaction effects were found in the 30-m sprint test (\u2009=\u20090.149; \u03b7p \u2009=\u20090.27, Pre-BA: 4.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25 s; Post-BA: 4.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.124 s; Pre-PLA: 4.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 s; Post-PLA: 4.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22 s). Neither plasma lactate levels nor RPE showed significant main effects of treatment or timepoint (all \u2009>\u20090.5). Conclusion: Two weeks of high-dose BA supplementation did not have an ergogenic impact on the distance covered during the intermittent endurance test, sprint performance, blood lactate, or RPE in trained futsal players.",

Resting muscle biopsies of the m. vastus lateralis were taken at 0, 12 and 24 weeks and analysed for taurine content (BA, N\u2009=\u200912; PL, N\u2009=\u20096) using high-performance liquid chromatography.

          "content": "Increasing nitric oxide bioavailability may induce physiological effects that enhance endurance exercise performance. This review sought to evaluate the performance effects of consuming foods containing compounds that may promote nitric oxide bioavailability. Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, EMBASE and SportDiscus were searched, with included studies assessing endurance performance following consumption of foods containing nitrate, L-arginine, L-citrulline or polyphenols. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted, with subgroup analyses performed based on food sources, sex, fitness, performance test type and supplementation protocol (e.g. duration). One hundred and eighteen studies were included in the meta-analysis, which encompassed 59 polyphenol studies, 56 nitrate studies and three L-citrulline studies. No effect on exercise performance following consumption of foods rich in L-citrulline was identified (SMD=-0.03, p=0.24). Trivial but significant benefits were demonstrated for consumption of nitrate and polyphenol-rich foods (SMD=0.15 and 0.17, respectively, p<0.001), including performance in time-trial, time-to-exhaustion and intermittent-type tests, and following both acute and multiple-day supplementation, but no effect of nitrate or polyphenol consumption was found in females. Among nitrate-rich foods, beneficial effects were seen for beetroot, but not red spinach or Swiss chard and rhubarb. For polyphenol-rich foods, benefits were found for grape, (nitrate-depleted) beetroot, French maritime pine, Montmorency cherry and pomegranate, while no significant effects were evident for New Zealand blackcurrant, cocoa, ginseng, green tea or raisins. Considerable heterogeneity between polyphenol studies may reflect food-specific effects or differences in study designs and subject characteristics. Well-trained males (V\u0307O \u226565 ml.kg.min) exhibited small, significant benefits following polyphenol, but not nitrate consumption. Foods rich in polyphenols and nitrate provide trivial benefits for endurance exercise performance, although these effects may be food dependent. Highly trained endurance athletes do not appear to benefit from consuming nitrate-rich foods but may benefit from polyphenol consumption. Further research into food sources, dosage and supplementation duration to optimise the ergogenic response to polyphenol consumption is warranted. Further studies should evaluate whether differential sex-based responses to nitrate and polyphenol consumption are attributable to physiological differences or sample size limitations. The review protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/u7nsj ) and no funding was provided.",

          "content": "Athletes often use sport supplements to improve their physical and physiological performance. This randomized, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of combined versus single supplementation of creatine (Cr), beta-alanine (BA), and L-citrulline (L-Cit) during short sprint interval training (SSIT)\u00a0on basketball players' physical and physiological performance over a period of 28\u00a0days. Forty-eight basketball players were equally assigned to 6 groups of Cr (0.1\u00a0g/kg of Cr monohydrate daily), BA (4.8\u00a0g daily), L-Cit (6\u00a0g daily), combined supplementation, PL, and an active control group, and each group consisted of 8 participants. The training groups participated in SSIT (3 sets of 10 repetitions of 5-s all-out runs) sessions 3 times a week for 4\u00a0weeks. Physical (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Illinois change of direction) and physiological (Wingate anaerobic power and cardiorespiratory fitness test) performance were evaluated before and after the training period. All training groups (Cr, BA, L-Cit, combined, and PL) showed significant improvements in physical and physiological performance over the 4-week intervention (P < .05). Interestingly, the supplement groups displayed significantly (P = .001) greater changes than the PL group, indicating better outcomes in performance adaptations. However, significant differences in performance variables were observed among the supplement groups. Our findings indicate that short-term supplementation with Cr, BA, and L-Cit, as well as a combination of them during SSIT, can significantly improve the physical and physiological performance of basketball players compared to a PL.",

          "content": "Given the increasing popularity of CrossFit as a high-intensity functional training program and the potential benefits of citrulline malate (CM) in enhancing exercise performance through its role as a precursor to L-arginine and nitric oxide production, this study aimed to investigate the acute effects of CM supplementation on CrossFit performance and cardiovascular function. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, 21 recreationally active participants (mean age 22.2 \u00b1 2.6 years, mean body weight 75.9 \u00b1 10.4 kg) with CrossFit experience completed the \"Cindy\" workout under CM and placebo conditions. Participants consumed 4.4 g of CM or a placebo 60 min before the workout, and the performance was measured by the number of rounds completed. Secondary outcomes included heart rate response, time spent in different heart rate intensity zones, and post-exercise recovery time. The results indicated no significant difference in the number of rounds completed between the CM and placebo conditions (13.5 \u00b1 5.2 vs. 13.8 \u00b1 6.7 rounds, respectively;  = 0.587). However, the time spent in zone 4 (80-90% of HR max) was significantly increased in the CM condition (527 \u00b1 395 s vs. 453 \u00b1 334 s;  = 0.017), suggesting a potential benefit for aerobic capacity and anaerobic threshold. No significant differences in post-exercise recovery time were observed (6.6 \u00b1 4.7 h vs. 6.9 \u00b1 4.7 h;  = 0.475). This study highlights the need for further research with larger sample sizes, both genders, and different CM dosages to clarify these findings and better understand CM's role in enhancing athletic performance.",

          "content": "Athletes are increasingly exploring ways to enhance their physical performance. Increasing blood flow to the working tissues through endothelium-dependent vasodilation is one factor athletes use to realize these results. Sports supplements such as pre-workouts tout this benefit; however, many have not been tested under laboratory conditions to examine the effects of commonly used supplements on vasodilation. Two popular supplements are Nitrosigine\u00ae and citrulline malate (CM). Thus, the purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of Nitrosigine and CM on vasodilation using ultrasound and flow mediated dilation (FMD). Healthy, normotensive, and physically active male (n\u2009=\u200916) and female (n\u2009=\u20098) young adults participated in the present investigation. We utilized a randomized, double-blind, within-subjects design where participants reported for three trials, each preceded by a 7-day washout period. Baseline FMD measurement was obtained for each visit, followed by consumption of one clinical dose CM (8\u2009g), Nitrosigine (1.5\u2009g), or dextrose placebo (8\u2009g). Following a 60-min digestion period, FMD was repeated. Supplementation order was randomized controlling for potential order effects. Repeated measures ANOVA yielded a significant supplement (3) x time (2) effect (p\u2009<\u2009.001), such that Nitrosigine and CM yielded a greater improvement in FMD response than placebo. After supplementation, Nitrosigine and CM increased FMD by 31 and 34%, respectively, compared to a decrease of 2% during the placebo trial. After allometric scaling of the FMD values, supplement x time effect remained significant (p\u2009=\u2009.001) and changes were similar to non-scaled results. Nitrosigine (23%) and CM (25%) generated significantly greater allometric scaled FMD values when compared to the placebo trial (0.60%). Both Nitrisigine and CM increased endothelial-dependent vasodilation as measured by a change in FMD. Increased vasodilation leads to an increase in skeletal muscle blood flow resulting in potential improvements in exercise performance.",

          "content": "Citrulline malate (CitMal) is a dietary supplement that is suggested to enhance strength training performance. However, there is conflicting evidence on this matter. Thus, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine whether supplementing with CitMal prior to strength training could increase the total number of repetitions performed before reaching voluntary muscular failure. A systematic search was conducted wherein the inclusion criteria were double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in healthy participants that examined the effect of CitMal on repetitions to failure during upper body and lower body resistance exercises. The Hedges's g standardized mean differences (SMD) between the placebo and CitMal trials were calculated and used in a random effect model. Two separate subanalyses were performed for upper body and lower body exercises. Eight studies, including 137 participants who consisted of strength-trained men (n = 101) and women (n = 26) in addition to untrained men (n = 9), fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Across the studies, 14 single-joint and multijoint exercises were performed with an average of 51 \u00b1 23 total repetitions during 5 \u00b1 3 sets per exercise at \u223c70% of one-repetition maximum. Supplementing with 6-8 g of CitMal 40-60\u00a0min before exercise increased repetitions by 3 \u00b1 5 (6.4 \u00b1 7.9%) compared with placebo (p = .022) with a small SMD (0.196). The subanalysis for the lower body resulted in a tendency for an effect of the supplement (8.1 \u00b1 8.4%, SMD: 0.27, p = .051) with no significant effect for the upper body (5.7 \u00b1 8.4%, SMD: 0.16, p = .131). The current analysis observed a small ergogenic effect of CitMal compared with placebo. Acute CitMal supplementation may, therefore, delay fatigue and enhance muscle endurance during high-intensity strength training.",

          "content": "The global market for nutritional supplements (NS) is growing rapidly, and the use of L-arginine (Arg), L-citrulline (Cit), and citrulline malate (CitMal) supplements has been shown to enhance cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Over the past decade, Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements have received considerable attention from researchers in the field of exercise nutrition, who have investigated their potential effects on hemodynamic function, endothelial function, aerobic and anaerobic capacity, strength, power, and endurance. Previous studies were reviewed to determine the potential impact of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and exercise performance. By synthesizing the existing literature, the study aimed to provide insight into the possible uses and limitations of these supplements for these purposes. The results showed that both recreational and trained athletes did not see improved physical performance or increased nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with 0.075 g or 6 g doses of Arg supplement per body weight. However, 2.4 to 6 g of Cit per day for 7 to 16 days of various NSs had a positive impact, increasing NO synthesis, enhancing athletic performance indicators, and reducing feelings of exertion. The effects of an 8 g acute dose of CitMal supplement were inconsistent, and more research is needed to determine its impact on muscle endurance performance. Based on the positive effects reported in previous studies, further testing is warranted in various populations that may benefit from nutritional supplements, including aerobic and anaerobic athletes, resistance-trained individuals, elderly people, and clinical populations, to determine the impact of different doses, timing of ingestion, and long-term and acute effects of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and athletic performance.",

Global positioning system (GPS)-derived external load was recorded throughout the intervention. Performance tests-a countermovement jump (CMJ) test and the Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT)-and blood sampling for plasma NO and nitrite (NO) concentrations were conducted at baseline and the day after a competitive match. : The supplementation with NIT + CM increased maximal speed (Vmax) throughout training and match play. During post-match testing, the NIT + CM group exhibited a significantly smaller decline in mean (P) and minimum (P) power during the WAnT, along with reduced power loss in both the first (0-15 s) and second (15-30 s) intervals. Plasma NO concentrations significantly increased from baseline in the NIT + CM group and remained elevated 24 h after the final dose, confirming sustained systemic exposure. : Chronic NIT + CM supplementation may enhance Vmax and help preserve anaerobic performance the day after a match.

Using a randomized and double-blind study design, 35 resistance-trained males (n\u2009=\u200918) and females (n\u2009=\u200917) completed four testing sessions following the ingestion of isolated caffeine (5\u00a0mg/kg), isolated CitMal (12\u00a0g), combined doses of caffeine and CitMal, and placebo. Supplements were ingested 60\u00a0min before performing a countermovement jump (CMJ) test (outcomes included jump height, rate of force development, peak force, and peak power), one-repetition maximum (1RM) squat and bench press, and repetitions to muscular failure in the squat and bench press with 60% of 1RM. Pain perception was evaluated following the repetitions to failure tests. The study was registered at ISRCTN (registration number: ISRCTN11694009). Compared to the placebo condition, isolated caffeine ingestion and co-ingestion of caffeine and CitMal significantly enhanced strength in 1RM bench press (Cohen's d: 0.05-0.06; 2.5-2.7%), muscular endurance in the squat (d: 0.46-0.58; 18.6-18.7%) and bench press (d: 0.48-0.64; 9.3-9.5%). However, there was no significant difference between isolated caffeine ingestion and caffeine co-ingested with CitMal, and isolated CitMal supplementation did not have an ergogenic effect in any outcome. No main effect of condition was found in the analysis for CMJ-derived variables, 1RM squat and pain perception. Caffeine ingestion appears to be ergogenic for muscular strength and muscular endurance, while adding CitMal does not seem to further enhance these effects.",

          "content": "Citrulline (CIT) and beetroot extract (BR) have separately shown benefits in rowing performance-related outcomes. However, effects of combined supplementation remain to be elucidated. The main purpose of this research was to study the effects of 1\u00a0week of daily co-supplementation of 3.5\u00a0g BR (500\u00a0mg NO) plus 6\u00a0g CIT on aerobic performance, maximal strength, and high-intensity power and peak stroke in elite male rowers compared to a placebo and to a BR supplementation. 20 elite rowers participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial completing 1\u00a0week of supplementation in each group of study: Placebo group (PLAG); BR group (BRG); and BR\u2009+\u2009CIT group (BR-CITG). 3 main physical tests were performed: aerobic performance, Wingate test and CMJ jump, and metabolic biomarkers and physiological outcomes were collected. The Wingate all-out test showed no between-condition differences in peak power, mean power, relative power, or fatigue index (P\u2009>\u20090.05), but clearance of lactate was better in BR-CITG (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In the performance test, peak power differed only between PLAG and BR-CITG (P\u2009=\u20090.036), while VO2peak and maximum heart rate remained similar. CMJ jumping test results showed no between-condition differences, and blood samples were consistent (P\u2009>\u20090.200). Supplementation with 3.5\u00a0g of BR extract plus 6\u00a0g of CIT for 7\u00a0days improved lactate clearance after Wingate test and peak power in a performance test. No further improvements were found, suggesting longer period of supplementation might be needed to show greater benefits.",

          "content": "Gonzalez, AM and Trexler, ET. Effects of citrulline supplementation on exercise performance in humans: A review of the current literature. J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1480-1495, 2020-L-citrulline, a nonessential amino acid found primarily in watermelon, has recently garnered much attention for its potential to augment L-arginine bioavailability, nitric oxide production, and exercise performance. Over the past decade, L-citrulline has received considerable scientific attention examining potentially ergogenic properties for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance. Thus, the purpose of this article is to summarize the theoretical rationale behind L-citrulline supplementation and to comprehensively review the available scientific evidence assessing the potential ergogenic value of L-citrulline supplementation on vascular function and exercise performance in humans. In addition, research that has investigated the potential synergistic effects of L-citrulline with other dietary ingredients (e.g., arginine, antioxidants, nitrates, and branched-chain amino acids) is reviewed. Oral L-citrulline and citrulline malate supplementation have shown to increase plasma citrulline and arginine concentrations, along with total nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Although blood flow enhancement is a proposed mechanism for the ergogenic potential of L-citrulline, evidence supporting acute improvements in vasodilation and skeletal muscle tissue perfusion after supplementation is scarce and inconsistent. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that L-citrulline supplementation can enhance exercise performance and recovery. Given the positive effects observed from some investigations, future studies should continue to investigate the effects of both acute and chronic supplementation with L-citrulline and citrulline malate on markers of blood flow and exercise performance and should seek to elucidate the mechanism underlying such effects.",

          "content": "Citrulline is a popular dietary supplement, primarily thought to exert ergogenic effects on exercise performance through the enhancement of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and ammonia buffering. However, recent findings surrounding citrulline's effect on endurance performance have been inconsistent. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature have yet to be undertaken. To determine if acute ingestion of citrulline has an ergogenic effect on endurance performance in young healthy adults. A systematic search of three databases was undertaken to find peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English investigating the effects of citrulline supplementation on endurance performance in young healthy adults. Two independent investigators completed a three-phased screening procedure against pre-determined eligibility criteria. Included studies evaluated loading or bolus dosage regimes of citrulline in participants aged 18 or over that were at least recreationally active. Outcome measures focused on time-to-completion (TTC) or time-to-exhaustion (TTE) in continuous submaximal intensity exercise. Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed-effects model to pool the weighted estimate of standardized mean differences (SMD) across studies. A chi-squared test assessed heterogeneity between studies. This review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Nine studies (\u2009=\u2009158 participants) met the eligibility criteria; five reported TTE outcomes (I\u2009=\u20090%, \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.37, df\u2009=\u20094, \u2009=\u20090.99) and four reported TTC outcomes (I\u2009=\u20090%, \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.46, df\u2009=\u20093, \u2009=\u20090.93), both with a low between-study heterogeneity. The results of the meta-analyses showed no significant difference in the endurance performance measures, TTE (pooled SMD\u2009=\u20090.03 [-0.27, 0.33]) and TTC (pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.07 [-0.50, 0.15]), after acute ingestion of citrulline supplementation or a control in young healthy adults. The current evidence suggests no significant benefit of citrulline supplementation for endurance performance. However, the small evidence base requires further research to fully evaluate this topic. Recommendations include a focus on female populations; higher continuous doses of citrulline over seven days; and TTC outcome measures over longer distances to simulate competition.",

          "content": "Use of supplements to aid performance is common practice amongst recreationally active individuals, including those without a sufficient evidence base. This investigation sought to assess whether acute supplementation with 8\u00a0g of citrulline malate (CM) (1.11: 1 ratio) would improve anaerobic performance. A randomised double blind placebo control trial was employed, using a counterbalanced design. We recruited recreationally active men and women to take part in an isokinetic chair protocol, based on German Volume Training (GVT) whereby participants attempted to perform 10 sets of 10 repetitions against a force representing 70% of their peak concentric force. The number of repetitions achieved over the course of the GVT was 94.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 and 90.9\u2009\u00b1\u200913.9 for placebo and CM respectively. There was no significant difference between the placebo and CM treatment for number of repetitions (P\u2009=\u20090.33), isometric (P\u2009=\u20090.60), concentric (P\u2009=\u20090.38), or eccentric (P\u2009=\u20090.65) peak force following the GVT. Total muscle soreness was significantly higher in the CM compared to the placebo treatment following the GVT protocol over 72\u00a0h (P\u2009=\u20090.01); although this was not accompanied by a greater workload/number of repetitions in the CM group. We conclude that an acute dose of CM does not significantly affect anaerobic performance using an isokinetic chair in recreational active participants. Practical implications include precaution in recommending CM supplementation. Coaches and athletes should be aware of the disparity between the chemical analyses of the products reviewed in the present investigation versus the manufacturers' claims.",

Nevertheless, its impact on nocturnal blood pressure dipping remains unexplored. Evaluate the impact of a single dose of CM on nocturnal blood pressure dipping after exercise in hypertensive individuals. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial, twenty hypertensive adults (55\u2009\u00b1\u200916\u2009years) were randomly assigned to either a CM (6\u2009g) or placebo (6\u2009g of corn starch) group (PLA). Resting blood pressure was measured after a 20-min period of comfortable seating in a calm environment. Both groups underwent 40\u2009min of treadmill running/walking at an intensity of 60-70% of their reserve heart rate, 120\u2009min after ingesting the substances. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was employed to measure blood pressure over 24\u2009h. No significant differences in systolic blood pressure values were observed between the CM and PLA groups at rest, during wakefulness, sleep, or over a 24-h period. However, CM exhibited a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure in several metrics: delta 24\u2009h (-14\u2009mmHg vs -6\u2009mmHg, \u2009=\u20090.047), delta wakefulness (-12\u2009mmHg vs -4\u2009mmHg, \u2009=\u20090.024), percent delta 24\u2009h (-16% vs -6%, \u2009=\u20090.024), and percent delta wakefulness (-14% vs -4%, \u2009=\u20090.013).

J Strength Cond Res 36(12): 3562-3570, 2022-This systematic review examines the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation (SUP) on muscle strength and hypertrophy when combined with physical exercise. The databases PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE were searched for full-text articles published between January 2000 and June 2020. For inclusion, studies had to report on the effects of SUP administered as acute or chronic doses together with a standardized exercise protocol on muscle strength and hypertrophy compared with placebo in healthy adults who were sedentary, physically active, or professional athletes. Twelve studies (1,571 subjects) were finally selected. In 5 studies, the SUP regime was acute, and in 7, it was chronic. SUP was nitrate-rich beetroot juice in 9 studies, a potassium nitrate capsule in 1, and increased dietary nitrate in 2. Ingested nitrate was 64-1,200 mg. Of the 12 studies, 6 observed an ergogenic effect of SUP compared with placebo. These findings indicate that muscle strength gains are possible provided the dose, format, frequency, period, and exercise test are appropriate. Best results were observed with a minimum acute dose of 400 mg of nitrate provided as beetroot juice/shot taken 2-2.5 hours before exercise involving low- and high-intensity muscle contractions. This SUP regime seems to improve muscle efficiency in terms of reduced phosphocreatine and energy costs (P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and improved time to exhaustion.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the influence of dietary nitrate supplementation on performance metrics during cycling sprint exercise according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted on MEDLINE, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases up to September 2023. Inclusion criteria were healthy recreationally active men and women who consumed nitrate-rich and nitrate-deficient beetroot juice to assess performance outcomes of mean power, peak power, time-to-peak power, and minimum power during 30-s cycling sprints. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 and TESTEX tools and funnel plots. A random effects model was performed on six studies and showed that dietary nitrate had significant effects on time-to-peak power (SMD: -0.66, 95% CI: -1.127 to -0.192,  = 0.006) but not on mean power, peak power, or minimum power. Subgroup analysis revealed that an acute low nitrate dose improved time-to-peak power (SMD: -0.977, 95% CI: -1.524 to -0.430,  < 0.001) but not after a multiday moderate nitrate dose (SMD: -0.177, 95% CI: -0.619 to -0.264,  = 0.431). These data suggest that acute nitrate supplementation can benefit time-to-peak power during 30-s cycling sprints, but due to the limited availability of data and heterogeneity in methodology, these results should be interpreted with caution. There was insufficient data on women to analyze sex-based differences. Future studies are required to provide insight on how supplementation regimen and population impact the effects of dietary nitrate for enhancing cycling sprint performance.",

          "content": "Dietary nitrate supplementation can enhance exercise performance in healthy people, but it is not clear if it is beneficial in COPD. We investigated the hypotheses that acute nitrate dosing would improve exercise performance and reduce the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise in people with COPD. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over single dose study. Subjects were randomised to consume either nitrate-rich beetroot juice (containing 12.9 mmoles nitrate) or placebo (nitrate-depleted beetroot juice) 3 hours prior to endurance cycle ergometry, performed at 70% of maximal workload assessed by a prior incremental exercise test. After a minimum washout period of 7 days the protocol was repeated with the crossover beverage. 21 subjects successfully completed the study (age 68 \u00b1 7 years; BMI 25.2 \u00b1 5.5 kg/m2; FEV1 percentage predicted 50.1 \u00b1 21.6%; peak VO2 18.0 \u00b1 5.9 ml/min/kg). Resting diastolic blood pressure fell significantly with nitrate supplementation compared to placebo (-7 \u00b1 8 mmHg nitrate vs. -1 \u00b1 8 mmHg placebo; p = 0.008). Median endurance time did not differ significantly; nitrate 5.65 (3.90-10.40) minutes vs. placebo 6.40 (4.01-9.67) minutes (p = 0.50). However, isotime oxygen consumption (VO2) was lower following nitrate supplementation (16.6 \u00b1 6.0 ml/min/kg nitrate vs. 17.2 \u00b1 6.0 ml/min/kg placebo; p = 0.043), and consequently nitrate supplementation caused a significant lowering of the amplitude of the VO2-percentage isotime curve. Acute administration of oral nitrate did not enhance endurance exercise performance; however the observation that beetroot juice caused reduced oxygen consumption at isotime suggests that further investigation of this treatment approach is warranted, perhaps targeting a more hypoxic phenotype.

We hypothesised that these effects might be sufficient to improve exercise performance in patients with COPD and hypoxia severe enough to require supplemental oxygen. We conducted a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, enrolling adults with COPD who were established users of long-term oxygen therapy. Participants performed an endurance shuttle walk test, using their prescribed oxygen, 3\u2009hours after consuming either 140\u2009mL of nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BRJ) (12.9\u2009mmol nitrate) or placebo (nitrate-depleted BRJ). Treatment order was allocated (1:1) by computer-generated block randomisation. The primary outcome was endurance shuttle walk test time. The secondary outcomes included area under the curve to isotime for fingertip oxygen saturation and heart rate parameters during the test, blood pressure, and endothelial function assessed using flow-mediated dilatation. Plasma nitrate and nitrite levels as well as FE were also measured. 20 participants were recruited and all completed the study. Nitrate-rich BRJ supplementation prolonged exercise endurance time in all participants as compared with placebo: median (IQR) 194.6 (147.5-411.7) s vs 159.1 (121.9-298.5) s, estimated treatment effect 62 (33-106)\u2009s (p<0.0001).

          "content": "The purpose of this review was to examine the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance by systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled human studies. A search of four electronic databases and cross-referencing found 17 studies investigating the effect of inorganic nitrate supplementation on exercise performance that met the inclusion criteria. Beetroot juice and sodium nitrate were the most common supplements, with doses ranging from 300 to 600 mg nitrate and prescribed in a manner ranging from a single bolus to 15 days of regular ingestion. Pooled analysis showed a significant moderate benefit (ES = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.23-1.35) of nitrate supplementation on performance for time to exhaustion tests (p = .006). There was a small but insignificant beneficial effect on performance for time trials (ES = 0.11, 95% CI: -0.16-0.37) and graded exercise tests (ES = 0.26, 95% CI: -0.10-0.62). Qualitative analysis suggested that performance benefits are more often observed in inactive to recreationally active individuals and when a chronic loading of nitrate over several days is undertaken. Overall, these results suggest that nitrate supplementation is associated with a moderate improvement in constant load time to exhaustion tasks. Despite not reaching statistical significance, the small positive effect on time trial or graded exercise performance may be meaningful in an elite sport context. More data are required to clarify the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance and to elucidate the optimal way to implement supplementation.",

          "content": "Oral inorganic nitrate (NO) supplementation has been shown to increase bioavailable NO and provide potential ergogenic benefits in males; however, data in females is scarce. Estrogen is known to increase endogenous NO bioavailability and to fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle (MC), being lowest in the early follicular (EF) phase and highest during the late follicular (LF) phase. This study examined the effects of oral NO supplementation on exercise economy, endurance capacity, and vascular health in young females across the MC. Ten normally menstruating females' MCs were tested in a double-blinded, randomized design during both the EF and LF phases of the MC. Participants consumed \u223c13 mmol NO, in the form of 140 mL beetroot juice (BRJ) or an identical NO-depleted placebo (PL) for \u223c3 days before lab visits and 2 h before testing on lab visits. Plasma nitrate, nitrite, and estradiol were assessed, as was blood pressure and pulse wave velocity. Moderate-intensity exercise economy and severe intensity time to exhaustion (TTE) were tested on a cycle ergometer. As expected, plasma estradiol was elevated in the LF phase, and plasma nitrite and nitrate were elevated in the BRJ condition. Exercise economy was unaltered by BRJ or the MC, however TTE was significantly worsened by 48 s (\u223c10%) after BRJ supplementation ( = 0.04), but was not different across the MC with no interaction effects. In conclusion, NO supplementation did not affect exercise economy or vascular health and worsened aerobic endurance capacity (TTE), suggesting healthy females should proceed with caution when considering supplementation with BRJ. Although inorganic nitrate (NO) supplementation has increased in popularity as a means of improving exercise performance, data in females at different phases of the menstrual cycle are lacking despite known interactions of estrogen with NO. This study revealed neither NO supplementation nor the menstrual cycle influenced exercise economy or vascular health in healthy young naturally menstruating females, while NO supplementation significantly worsened endurance capacity (10%) independent of the menstrual cycle phase.",

          "content": "Dietary nitrate supplementation has been shown to decrease the oxygen cost of exercise and prolong exercise tolerance, as measured by sub-maximal exercise endurance distance and time at 85% V\u0307O2max, in both elite athletes and normal healthy subjects. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have reduced quality of life and ability to perform activities of daily living attributable to diminished exercise tolerance, and dietary nitrate may be able to ameliorate this. We performed a double-blind, computer-randomized placebo control crossover trial at a tertiary Australian hospital to investigate whether dietary nitrate supplementation as beetroot juice (BR) would augment submaximal exercise endurance in individuals with spirometrically confirmed stable moderate COPD. Volunteers underwent an incremental shuttle walk test to determine V\u0307O2max followed by a test dose of BR to establish safety in the study population. Participants performed an endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) at 85% V\u0307O2max after randomization to either a 3 day wash-in of BR (4.8 mmol twice a day) or placebo (nitrate deplete BR), with a final dose on the morning of testing. They then crossed over after 4 day washout. Repeated measures two sided paired t-tests were employed. 35 participants were recruited with 19 completing the trial. In the initial safety phase, we measured systolic blood pressure over four hours post first dose of BR, and found a mean 10 mmHg decrement maximal at 1 hour. One individual developed symptomatic postural hypotension and was excluded. The primary outcomes of ESWT distance and time to fatigue improved by 11% and 6% respectively; however these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.494 and 0.693 respectively). Our study does not support a role for routine dietary nitrate supplementation for enhancement of exercise endurance in COPD. Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trial Register: ACTRN12611001088932.",

We hypothesized that, independent of antihypertensive medication status, dietary nitrate supplementation would increase limb blood flow, decrease mean arterial pressure (MAP), and increase limb vascular conductance during exercise in patients with hypertension. Patients with hypertension either abstained from ( = 14, Off-Meds) or continued ( = 12, On-Meds) antihypertensive medications. Within each group, patients consumed (crossover design) nitrate-rich or nitrate-depleted (placebo) beetroot juice for 3 days before performing handgrip (HG) and knee-extensor exercise (KE). Blood flow and MAP were measured using Doppler ultrasound and an automated monitor, respectively. Dietary nitrate increased plasma-[nitrite] Off-Meds and On-Meds. There were no significant effects of dietary nitrate on blood flow, MAP, or vascular conductance during HG in Off-Meds or On-Meds. For KE, dietary nitrate decreased MAP (means \u00b1 SD across all 3 exercise intensities, 118\u2009\u00b1\u200914 vs. 122\u2009\u00b1\u200914 mmHg,  = 0.024) and increased vascular conductance (26.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 vs. 24.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.0 mL/min/mmHg,  = 0.024), but did not affect blood flow for Off-Meds, with no effects On-Meds. Dietary nitrate-induced changes in blood flow ( = -0.67,  < 0.001), MAP ( = -0.43,  = 0.009), and vascular conductance ( = -0.64,  < 0.001) during KE, but only vascular conductance ( = -0.35,  = 0.039) during HG, were significantly related to the magnitude of placebo values, with no differentiation between groups. Thus, the effects of dietary nitrate on limb hemodynamics and MAP during exercise in patients with hypertension are dependent on the values at baseline, independent of antihypertensive medication status, and dependent on whether exercise was performed by the forearm or quadriceps. Adverse hemodynamic responses to exercise in patients with hypertension, despite antihypertensive medication, indicate a sustained cardiovascular risk. The efficacy of dietary nitrate to improve limb vascular conductance during exercise was inversely dependent on the magnitude of exercising limb vascular conductance at baseline, rather than antihypertensive medication status. The effects of dietary nitrate on hemodynamics during exercise in patients with hypertension are dependent on the values at baseline and independent of antihypertensive medication status.",

However, nitrate may exacerbate acute mountain sickness (AMS), specifically headache. This study investigated the effect of nitrate supplementation on AMS symptoms and exercise responses with 6-h hypoxia. Twenty recreationally active men [age, 22 \u00b1 4 yr, maximal oxygen consumption (V\u0307o), 51 \u00b1 6 ml\u00b7min\u00b7kg, means \u00b1 SD] completed this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study. Twelve participants were classified as AMS- on the basis of Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire [Acute Cerebral Mountain Sickness score (AMS-C)] <0.7 in both trials, and five participants were classified as AMS+ on the basis of AMS-C \u22650.7 on placebo. Five days of nitrate supplementation (70-ml beetroot juice containing ~6.4 mmol nitrate daily) increased plasma NO metabolites by 182 \u00b5M compared with placebo but did not reduce AMS or improve exercise performance. After 4-h hypoxia [inspired O fraction ([Formula: see text])\u2009=\u20090.124], nitrate increased AMS-C and headache severity (visual analog scale; whole sample \u220610 [1, 20] mm, mean difference [95% confidence interval];  = 0.03) compared with placebo. In addition, after 5-h hypoxia, nitrate increased sense of effort during submaximal exercise (\u22067 [-1, 14];  = 0.07). In AMS-, nitrate did not alter headache or sense of effort. In contrast, in AMS+, nitrate increased headache severity (\u220626 [-3, 56] mm;  = 0.07), sense of effort (\u220614 [1, 28];  = 0.04), oxygen consumption, ventilation, and mean arterial pressure during submaximal exercise. On the next day, in a separate acute hypoxic exercise test ([Formula: see text]\u2009=\u20090.141), nitrate did not improve time to exhaustion at 80% hypoxic V\u0307o In conclusion, dietary nitrate increases AMS and sense of effort during exercise, particularly in those who experience AMS. Dietary nitrate is therefore not recommended as an AMS prophylactic or ergogenic aid in nonacclimatized individuals at altitude. This is the first study to identify that the popular dietary nitrate supplement (beetroot) does not reduce acute mountain sickness (AMS) or improve exercise performance during 6-h hypoxia. The consumption of nitrate in those susceptible to AMS exacerbates AMS symptoms (headache) and sense of effort and raises oxygen cost, ventilation, and blood pressure during walking exercise in 6-h hypoxia. These data question the suitability of nitrate supplementation during altitude travel in nonacclimatized people.",

Eleven recreationally active male participants (27\u2009\u00b1\u20095 yr, V\u0307o: 42\u2009\u00b1\u20092 mL/kg/min) performed two experimental trials following 3 days of either dietary nitrate-rich beetroot juice (4.1 mmol NO/day; DNS) or placebo (PLA) supplementation in a blinded, counterbalanced order. Exercise consisted of constant-load cycling at 50, 75, and 100 W (4 min each) and, at \u223c80% of peak power output (218\u2009\u00b1\u200912 W), to task-failure. All participants returned to repeat the shorter of the two trials performed to task failure, but with the opposite supplementation regime (iso-time comparison; ISO). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), leg blood flow (Q; Doppler ultrasound), leg vascular conductance (LVC), and pulmonary gas exchange were continuously assessed during exercise. Locomotor muscle fatigue was determined by the change in pre to postexercise quadriceps twitch-torque (\u0394Q) and voluntary activation (\u0394VA; electrical femoral nerve stimulation). Following DNS, plasma [nitrite] (\u223c670 vs. \u223c180 nmol) and [nitrate] (\u223c775 vs. \u223c11 \u03bcmol) were significantly elevated compared with PLA. Unlike PLA, DNS lowered both Q and MAP by \u223c8% ( < 0.05), but did not alter LVC ( = 0.31). V\u0307O across work rates, as well as cycling time to task-failure (\u223c7 min) and locomotor muscle fatigue following the ISO-time comparison were not different between the two conditions (\u0394Q \u223c42%, \u0394VA \u223c4%). Thus, despite significant hemodynamic changes, DNS did not alter the development of locomotor muscle fatigue and, ultimately, cycling time to task failure. This study sought to characterize the impact of dietary nitrate supplementation on the hemodynamic response, locomotor muscle fatigue, and time to task failure during cycling exercise. Although nitrate supplementation lowered mean arterial pressure and exercising leg blood flow, leg vascular conductance and oxygen utilization were unaffected. Despite significant hemodynamic changes, there was no effect of dietary nitrate on neuromuscular fatigue development and, ultimately, cycling time to task failure.",

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) were an experimental trial published in an English peer-reviewed journal; (b) compared the effects of inorganic nitrate consumption with a non-bioactive supplement control or placebo; (c) used a quantifiable measure of exercise performance; and (d) was carried out in apparently healthy participants without disease. A total of 29 studies were identified that investigated the effects of nitrate supplementation on exercise tolerance or performance in accordance with the criteria outlined. Analysis using time to exhaustion as the outcome variable revealed a significant effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise tolerance (ES = 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.47; p = 0.006) compared with placebo. Analysis using time to complete a specific distance as the outcome variable revealed no significant effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance (ES = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.28 to 0.17; p = 0.64) compared with placebo. Nitrate supplementation is likely to improve exercise tolerance and capacity that may improve exercise performance. More research is required to determine the optimal dose and duration of nitrate supplementation. It would also be important to consider the type of athlete performing the exercise and the duration, intensity, and mode of the exercise performed because these factors are likely to influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation.",

We investigated the hypotheses that nitrate supplementation would also attenuate low-frequency fatigue and the loss of explosive voluntary forces in fatigued conditions. In a counterbalanced double-blinded order, 17 male participants completed two experimental trials after 7 d of dietary supplementation with either nitrate-rich (NIT) or nitrate-depleted (PLA) beetroot juice. Each trial consisted of measuring isometric knee extension forces during a series of explosive maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) and involuntary tetanic contractions (at 10, 20 50, and 100 Hz) in unfatigued conditions, followed by a fatigue protocol of 60 MVC and a repeat of the tetanic contractions immediately after the 60 MVC. In unfatigued conditions, there was no effect of NIT on any of the measured dependent variables, including maximal voluntary force, explosive impulse, and tetanic peak forces or peak rate of force developments at any frequency. In contrast, the percentage decline in explosive voluntary impulse from the first to the last 6 MVC in the fatigue protocol was lower in NIT (51.1% \u00b1 13.9%) than in PLA (57.3% \u00b1 12.4%; P = 0.039; d = 0.51). Furthermore, low-frequency fatigue determined via the percentage decline in the 20/50-Hz ratio was attenuated in NIT for tetanic peak force (NIT: 12.3% \u00b1 12.0% vs PLA: 17.0% \u00b1 10.1%; P = 0.110; d = 0.46) and tetanic peak rate force development (NIT: 12.3% \u00b1 10.4% vs PLA: 20.3% \u00b1 9.5%; P = 0.011; d = 0.83). Nitrate supplementation reduced the decline in explosive voluntary forces during a fatiguing protocol and attenuated low-frequency fatigue, likely due to reduced disruption of excitation-contraction coupling. However, contrary to previous findings, nitrate supplementation had no effect on contractile performance in unfatigued conditions.",

          "content": "Dietary nitrate supplementation has been shown to reduce O2 cost of submaximal exercise, improve exercise tolerance, and enhance performance in moderately trained individuals. In contrast, data have been provided that elite athletes do not benefit from nitrate supplementation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of short-term nitrate supplementation on endurance performance in subjects with different levels of aerobic fitness. Twenty-one subjects (mean age, 22.7 \u00b1 1.8 yr) with different aerobic fitness level (V\u02d9O2peak value ranging from 28.2 to 81.7 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min) participated in a crossover double-blind placebo-controlled study. Subjects were tested after 6 d of supplementation with either 0.5 l per day of nitrate (5.5 mmol)-containing water (NITR) or nitrate-free water (PLA). Participants performed an incremental running test until exhaustion and four repetitions of 6-min submaximal (approximately 80% of gas exchange threshold) constant load exercise on a motorized treadmill. Moreover, subjects performed a 3-km running time trial on the field. After NITR, a negative correlation between reduction of O2 cost of submaximal exercise and individual aerobic fitness level was observed (r = 0.80; P < 0.0001). A significant inverse correlation was also found between aerobic fitness level and improvement in performance for 3-km time trial after NITR (r = 0.76; P < 0.0001). Additionally, subjects responded differently to dietary nitrate supplementation according to aerobic fitness level with higher-fit subjects showing a lower increase in plasma [NO3] (r = 0.86; P < 0.0001) and [NO2] (r = 0.75; P < 0.0001). The results of the present study suggest that the individual aerobic fitness level affects the ergogenic benefits induced by dietary nitrate supplementation. The optimal nitrate loading regimen required to elevate plasma [NO2] and to enhance performance in elite athletes is different from that of low-fit subjects and requires further studies.",

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 44 resistance-trained men (age: 26 \u00b1 4 years; body mass: 84.9 \u00b1 12.0\u00a0kg) consuming \u22651.7\u00a0g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7day-1 of protein received HMB-FA (3\u00a0g/day; n = 14), HMB-Ca (3\u00a0g/day; n = 15), or placebo (PL; cornstarch, 3\u00a0g/day; n = 15) for 12 weeks, while performing a periodized resistance training program. Before and after intervention, lean body mass (measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry), maximal dynamic strength (one-repetition maximum), knee extension maximal isometric strength (maximal voluntary isometric contraction [MVIC]), cross-sectional area (measured with ultrasound), and muscle soreness were assessed. MVIC was also measured 48\u00a0hr after the first and the last training sessions. All groups increased lean body mass (main time effect: p < .0001; HMB-FA: 1.8 \u00b1 1.8\u00a0kg; HMB-Ca: 0.8 \u00b1 1.4\u00a0kg; PL: 0.9 \u00b1 1.4\u00a0kg), cross-sectional area (main time effect: p < .0001; HMB-FA: 6.6 \u00b1 3.8%; HMB-Ca: 4.7 \u00b1 4.4%; PL: 6.9 \u00b1 3.8%), one-repetition maximum bench press (main time effect: p < .0001; HMB-FA: 14.8 \u00b1 8.4\u00a0kg; HMB-Ca: 11.8 \u00b1 7.4\u00a0kg; PL: 11.2 \u00b1 6.6\u00a0kg), MVIC (main time effect: p < .0001; HMB-FA: 34.4 \u00b1 39.3%; HMB-Ca: 32.3 \u00b1 27.4%; PL: 17.7 \u00b1 20.9%) after the intervention, but no differences between groups were shown. HMB-FA group showed greater leg press strength after the intervention than HMB-Ca and PL groups (Group \u00d7 Time interaction: p < .05; HMB-FA: 47.7 \u00b1 31.2\u00a0kg; HMB-Ca: 43.8 \u00b1 31.7\u00a0kg; PL: 30.2 \u00b1 20.9\u00a0kg). MVIC measured 48\u00a0hr after the first and the last sessions showed no attenuation of force decline with supplementation.

          "content": "Studies utilizing beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation in trained populations are limited. No long-term studies utilizing HMB free acid (HMB-FA) have been conducted. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 12 weeks of HMB-FA supplementation on skeletal muscle hypertrophy, body composition, strength, and power in trained individuals. We also determined the effects of HMB-FA on muscle damage and performance during an overreaching cycle. A three-phase double-blind, placebo- and diet-controlled randomized intervention study was conducted. Phase 1 was an 8-week-periodized resistance-training program; Phase 2 was a 2-week overreaching cycle; and Phase 3 was a 2-week taper. Muscle mass, strength, and power were examined at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 to assess the chronic effects of HMB-FA; and assessment of these, as well as cortisol, testosterone, and creatine kinase (CK) was performed at weeks 9 and 10 of the overreaching cycle. HMB-FA resulted in increased total strength (bench press, squat, and deadlift combined) over the 12-week training (77.1 \u00b1 18.4 vs. 25.3 \u00b1 22.0 kg, p < 0.001); a greater increase in vertical jump power (991 \u00b1 168 vs. 630 \u00b1 167 W, p < 0.001); and increased lean body mass gain (7.4 \u00b1 4.2 vs. 2.1 \u00b1 6.1 kg, p < 0.001) in HMB-FA- and placebo-supplemented groups, respectively. During the overreaching cycle, HMB-FA attenuated increases in CK (-6 \u00b1 91 vs. 277 \u00b1 229 IU/l, p < 0.001) and cortisol (-0.2 \u00b1 2.9 vs. 4.5 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcg/dl, p < 0.003) in the HMB-FA- and placebo-supplemented groups, respectively. These results suggest that HMB-FA enhances hypertrophy, strength, and power following chronic resistance training, and prevents decrements in performance following the overreaching.",

          "content": "Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, is currently widely used in athletes to increase muscle mass and strength and has also been used as a nutritional supplement in recent years to maintain muscle mass in muscular atrophic diseases of older people. However, the effects of HMB supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function in older people remain controversial. The purpose of this review was to explore the effects of HMB on body composition in older adults. The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to obtain the randomized controlled trials needed as a basis for systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of 9 studies (448 participants) were eventually found eligible. The pooled results showed that HMB supplementation significantly increased fat-free mass in older people compared with the control group (effect size: 0.37; 95% Cl 0.16, 0.58; Z value\u2009=\u20093.47, P\u2009=\u20090.001; Fixed-effect model). But it had no effect on fat mass (effect size: -\u00a00.04 95% CI -\u00a00.26, 0.18; Z value\u2009=\u20090.36, P\u2009=\u20090.716, fixed-effect model). Subgroup analysis of HMB supplementation alone showed a significant improvement in fat-free mass in older people (effect size: 0.59; 95% CI 0.32, 0.87; Z\u2009=\u20094.24, P\u2009<\u20090.001; fixed-effect model), whereas HMB supplementation combined with exercise intervention showed no additional fat-free mass change (effect size: 0.06; 95% CI -\u00a00.26, 0.38; Z\u2009=\u20090.38, P\u2009=\u20090.705; Fixed-effect model). HMB supplementation is beneficial for improving body composition in older people. However, the effect of HMB supplementation combined with exercise therapy to improve muscle mass is not obvious. Exercise programs need to be designed according to the different physical health of older people.",

J Strength Cond Res 36(2): 585-592, 2022-The purpose of this article was to systematically review and meta-analyze the current literature to determine the effects of HMB on body composition in athletes. Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) were an experimental design published in a peer-reviewed, English-language journal; (b) included human athletic populations; (c) assessed body mass (BM), fat mass (FM), or fat-free mass (FFM) using a validated measure; (d) and had a minimum supplementation period of 4 weeks. Separate analyses were performed for BM, FM, and FFM using robust variance random-effects meta-regression for multilevel data structures, with adjustments for small samples. The final analysis of BM comprised a total of 208 subjects from 7 studies. Analysis of FFM and FM encompassed 5 studies comprising 161 subjects and 5 studies comprising 128 subjects, respectively. The principal finding of this analysis suggests HMB may have a small, positive impact on FFM in athletes (0.30 \u00b1 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.07 to 0.68; p = 0.08), although this seems specific to when protein intake is suboptimal (<1.6 g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1). Consistent with previous research on athletes, HMB demonstrated no significant effect on BM (-0.02 \u00b1 0.04; 95% CI: -0.14 to 0.10; p = 0.70) and a small, nonsignificant effect on FM (-0.33 \u00b1 0.23; 95% CI: -0.96 to 0.31; p = 0.22). More research is required to establish HMB's influence on FFM in athletes. It is also important to consider the dosage of HMB and training parameters of athletes because these will likely influence the efficacy of supplementation.",

          "content": "Muscular damage sustained while playing rugby may hinder performance across a season. \u03b2-Hydroxy \u03b2-Methylbutyrate (HMB) may help attenuate muscle damage and maintain lean mass and performance. This study sought to determine the effect of combining HMB with creatine monohydrate supplementation on measures of stress and muscle damage, body composition, strength and sprinting kinetics throughout a rugby season. This double-blind, cross-over investigation recruited 16 male collegiate rugby players to provide resting blood samples and complete assessments of body composition, strength and sprinting performance prior to their fall season (PRE). After testing, the athletes were matched for fat-free mass and assigned to consume one of two supplementation regimens for 6\u2009weeks: 5\u2009g HMB\u2009+\u20095\u2009g creatine per day (HMB-Cr: 20.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009years; 177\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009cm; 88.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u2009kg) or 5\u2009g creatine +\u20095\u2009g placebo per day (Cr: 21.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009years; 179\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009cm; 88.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u2009kg). After 6\u2009weeks (POST), PRE testing was repeated in 13 of the original 16 athletes before a 10-wk wash-out period. Athletes who returned for the spring season (n\u2009=\u20098) repeated all fall-season procedures and testing prior to (PRE) and following (POST) their 6-wk spring season, except they were assigned to the opposite supplementation regimen. Linear mixed models with repeated measures revealed group x time interactions (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.05) for observed for several measures but did not consistently and positively favor one group. During the fall season, knee extensor peak torque was reduced by 40.7\u2009\u00b1\u200928.1\u2009Nm (p\u2009=\u20090.035) for HMB-Cr but remained consistent for Cr, and no group differences or changes were noted in the spring. In the spring, greater knee flexor rate of torque development (~\u2009149\u2009Nm\u00b7sec, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and impulse (~\u20094.5\u2009Nm\u00b7sec, p\u2009=\u20090.022) were observed in Cr at PRE but not at POST. Although significant interactions were found for cortisol concentrations, vastus lateralis pennation angle, and sprinting force, post-hoc analysis only revealed differences between fall and spring seasons. No other differences were observed. The combination of HMB and creatine monohydrate supplementation does not provide a greater ergogenic benefit compared to creatine monohydrate supplementation alone. Body composition, strength, and sprinting ability did not change across the season with creatine monohydrate supplementation.",

          "content": "Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a popular supplement in the resistance training community, with its use supported by claims of increased strength, muscle growth, and improved recovery; however, research outcomes are variable. Therefore, we meta-analyzed the effectiveness of HMB on strength, body composition, and muscle damage. Nine qualifying studies yielded 14 comparisons subcategorized by training experience (trained, untrained) to provide 12-13 estimates of strength (upper body, lower body, overall average), 13 estimates of fat and fat-free mass, and 7 estimates of the muscle-damage marker creatine kinase. The meta-analysis comprised 394 subjects (age 23 +/- 2 years, mean +/- between-study SD) with 5 +/- 2 weeks' intervention and 5 +/- 6 h.wk of training. The estimates were analyzed using a meta-analytic mixed model with study sample size as the weighting factor that included the main-effect covariates to control for between-study differences in HMB dose, intervention duration, training load, and dietary cointervention. To interpret magnitudes, meta-analyzed effects were standardized using the composite baseline between-subject SD and were qualified using modified Cohen effect size thresholds. There were small benefits to lower-body (mean +/- 90% confidence limit: 9.9% +/- 5.9%) and average strength (6.6 +/- 5.7%), but only negligible gains for upper-body strength (2.1 +/- 5.5%) were observed in untrained lifters. In trained lifters, all strength outcomes were trivial. Combined (all studies), the overall average strength increase was trivial (3.7 +/- 2.4%), although uncertainty allows for a small benefit. Effects on fat and fat-free mass were trivial, and results regarding creatine kinase were unclear. Supplementation with HMB during resistance training incurs small but clear overall and leg strength gains in previously untrained men, but effects in trained lifters are trivial. The HMB effect on body composition is inconsequential. An explanation for strength gains in previously untrained lifters requires further research.",

          "content": "Growing evidence suggests beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate's (HMB) positive effects on recovery following exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). However, findings vary substantially across studies. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to assess the effects of HMB supplementation on recovery following EIMD by assessing indirect markers of muscle damage, namely creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels among healthy participants. A comprehensive search was performed on electronic databases (Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar) up to October 2017 for trials evaluating the effects of HMB on recovery following EIMD. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation of follow-up CK and LDH concentrations were extracted to calculate the effect size for meta-analysis. A total of 324 participants for CK and 229 participants for LDH were found from the 10 and 8 studies, respectively. The results revealed a significant effect of HMB supplementation on CK (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -60.71 UL; 95% confidence interval [CI], -78.12 to -43.29; I = 4.1%; p = 0.40) and LDH reduction (WMD = -15.42 UL; 95% CI, -22.2 to -8.6; I = 0.0%; p = 0.53). In addition, a subgroup analysis based on study duration (< 6\u00a0weeks vs. \u2265 6\u00a0weeks) suggested that HMB effectiveness on EIMD was statistically significant in studies over 6\u00a0weeks (p < 0.001). The current evidence revealed a time-dependent effect of HMB in reducing LDH and CK serum levels among adults. HMB, therefore, may be seen as a priority muscle damage recovery agent in interventions.",

A muscle damage protocol was applied 60 min after supplementation, and consisted of 7 sets of 20 drop jumps from a 60-cm box with 2-min rest intervals between sets. Muscle swelling, countermovement jump (CMJ), maximal voluntary isometric torque (MVIT), and work capacity (WC) were measured before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h after the exercise protocol. Muscle swelling, CMJ, and MVIT changed similarly in both groups after the exercise protocol (p < 0.001), but returned to pre-exercise levels after 24 h in both groups. WC decreased similarly in both groups after the exercise protocol (p < 0.01). For HMB-FA, WC returned to pre-exercise level 24 h after exercise protocol. However, for PLA, WC did not return to pre-exercise level even 72 h after the exercise protocol. In summary, a single-dose of HMB-FA supplementation improved WC recovery after a high-intensity exercise bout. However, HMB-FA did not affect the time-course of muscle swelling, MVIT, and CMJ recovery.",

J Strength Cond Res 38(4): e202-e210, 2024-\u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) has been used extensively as a dietary supplement for athletes and physically active people. However, the ergogenic effect of HMB supplementation on endurance performance is still unclear. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) aimed to assess HMB supplementation on endurance performance and V\u0307O 2 max . This SRMA followed PRISMA guidelines. Three electronic databases were searched (PubMed/Medline, Web of Science [WOS], and Scopus) from inception until April 3, 2023. In this SRMA, human experimental trials, controlled with a placebo group, assessing the effect of HMB supplementation on endurance performance in a healthy population were included. The quality of the studies was assessed by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The study protocol was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Review (PROSPERO): CRD42022341790. Eleven studies involving 279 participants met the inclusion criteria. The results displayed a significant improvement on endurance performance (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.58 [0.28-0.87]) and V\u0307O 2 max (pooled SMD = 0.58 [0.21-0.95]) after HMB ingestion. Moreover, after the exclusion of the studies not evenly distributed around the base of the funnel plot, the results continued to be significantly positive in endurance performance (pooled SMD = 0.38 [0.22-0.53]) and V\u0307O 2 max (pooled SMD = 0.25 [0.09-0.42]).

          "content": "\u03b2-Hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB), a leucine metabolite, can increase skeletal muscle size and function. However, HMB may be less effective at improving muscle function in people with insufficient Vitamin D3 (25-OH-D < 30 ng/mL) which is common in middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that combining HMB plus Vitamin D3 (HMB + D) supplementation would improve skeletal muscle size, composition, and function in middle-aged women. In a double-blinded fashion, women (53 \u00b1 1 yrs, 26 \u00b1 1 kg/m2, n = 43) were randomized to take placebo or HMB + D (3 g Calcium HMB + 2000 IU D per day) during 12 weeks of sedentary behavior (SED) or resistance exercise training (RET). On average, participants entered the study Vitamin D3 insufficient while HMB + D increased 25-OH-D to sufficient levels after 8 and 12 weeks. In SED, HMB + D prevented the loss of arm lean mass observed with placebo. HMB + D increased muscle volume and decreased intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) volume in the thigh compared to placebo but did not change muscle function. In RET, 12-weeks of HMB + D decreased IMAT compared to placebo but did not influence the increase in skeletal muscle volume or function. In summary, HMB + D decreased IMAT independent of exercise status and may prevent the loss or increase muscle size in a small cohort of sedentary middle-aged women. These results lend support to conduct a longer duration study with greater sample size to determine the validity of the observed positive effects of HMB + D on IMAT and skeletal muscle in a small cohort of middle-aged women.",

          "content": "Creatine monohydrate (CrM) and \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) are common ergogenic aids in the field of sports and are frequently used in an isolated way. However, there are a few studies that have investigated the effect of combining both supplements on different variables related to performance, with controversial results. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and the degree of potentiation of 10 weeks of CrM plus HMB supplementation on sports performance, which was measured by an incremental test to exhaustion in elite male traditional rowers. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 10-week study, participants ( = 28) were randomized to a placebo group (PLG;  = 7), CrM group (0.04 g/kg/day of CrM;  = 7), HMB group (3 g/day of HMB;  = 7) and CrM-HMB group (0.04 g/kg/day of CrM plus 3 g/day of HMB;  = 7). Before and after 10 weeks of different treatments, an incremental test was performed on a rowing ergometer to calculate the power that each rower obtained at the anaerobic threshold (WAT), and at 4 mmol (W4) and 8 mmol (W8) of blood lactate concentration. There were no significant differences in WAT and W4 among groups or in body composition. However, it was observed that the aerobic power achieved at W8 was significantly higher in the CrM-HMB group than in the PLG, CrM and HMB groups ( < 0.001; \u03b72 = 0.766). Likewise, a synergistic effect of combined supplementation was found for the sum of the two supplements separately at WAT (CrM-HMBG = 403.19% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 337.52%), W4 (CrM-HMBG = 2736.17% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 1705.32%) and W8 (CrM-HMBG = 1293.4% vs. CrMG+HMBG = 877.56%). In summary, CrM plus HMB supplementation over 10 weeks showed a synergistic effect on aerobic power (measured as WAT, W4, and W8) during an incremental test but had no influence muscle mass.",

          "content": "\u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a leucine metabolite that is purported to increase fat-free mass (FFM) gain and performance in response to resistance exercise training (RET). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of HMB supplementation in augmenting FFM and strength gains during RET in young adults. Outcomes investigated were: total body mass (TBM), FFM, fat mass (FM), total single repetition maximum (1RM), bench press (BP) 1RM, and lower body (LwB) 1RM. Databases consulted were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (Embase), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SportDiscus. Fourteen studies fit the inclusion criteria; however, 11 were analyzed after data extraction and funnel plot analysis exclusion. A total of 302 participants (18-45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 248 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes. We conclude that HMB produces a small effect on TBM gain, but this effect does not translate into significantly greater increases in FFM, strength or decreases in FM during periods of RET. Our findings do not support the use of HMB aiming at improvement of body composition or strength with RET.",

          "title": "Association between endogenous plasma beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate levels and frailty in community-dwelling older people.",
          "content": "Frailty is a key element in healthy ageing in which muscle performance plays a main role. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation has shown favourable effects in modulating protein synthesis, improving muscle mass and function in interventional studies. Decreased age-related endogenous HMB levels have been shown in previous studies. The aim of the present study is to assess whether there is an association between endogenous plasma HMB levels and frailty. Data from 1290 subjects (56.98% women; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation age 74.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.95\u00a0years) from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging were obtained. Participants had their frailty status qualified according to Fried's Frailty Phenotype (FFP) score and the Frailty Trait Scale in its 12-domain version (FTS-12). Plasma HMB levels were analysed by an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Differences between groups (frail vs. non-frail) were tested using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-squared test. The association between HMB and frailty was assessed by multivariate linear and logistic regressions when frailty was analysed as continuous and binary, respectively. Models were adjusted by age, gender, comorbidity, body composition and protein intake. HMB levels were lower in those aged \u226575\u00a0years than in those aged 65-74\u00a0years, with an inverse linear relationship between age and HMB levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.031; P\u00a0=\u00a00.018), mainly accounted by males (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.062; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). HMB levels were higher in men (0.238\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.065 vs. 0.193\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.051\u00a0ng/mL; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). HMB levels were significantly lower in frail than in non-frail individuals: 0.204\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.058 versus 0.217\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.063\u00a0ng/dL (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) according to the FFP and 0.203\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.059 versus 0.219\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.063\u00a0ng/mL (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) according to FTS-12. These differences showed a dose-dependent profile when we compared them by quintiles of HMB (P for trend: 0.022; 0.012 and 0.0004, respectively, for FFP, FTS-12 binary and FTS-12 continuous). Variables associated with low HMB levels were body mass index, strength, exhaustion and weight loss. Frailty was associated with HMB levels in all the adjusted models, including the fully adjusted ones, no matter the tool used (odds ratio: 0.45 [0.26, 0.77] for FFP and 0.36 [0.20, 0.63] for FTS-12 binary; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-4.76 [-7.29, -2.23] for FTS-12 score). This association was also observed when the analyses were done by quintiles, showing such association since Q4 (FFP), Q2 (FTS-12 binary) and Q3 (FTS-12 score). The associations were observed in the whole sample and in each gender. There is an inverse association between HMB levels and frailty status. These findings support the design of targeted clinical trials to evaluate the effect of HMB supplementation in older frail people with low HMB levels.",

This secondary analysis aimed to test whether \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation enhances the effects of resistance training (RT) on MQ in older women with low muscle mass. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-by-two factorial design trial was conducted at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. Women age 65-79 yr with a skeletal muscle mass index of <5.7 kg\u00b7m-2 were randomly allocated to one of four arms (RT + HMB, RT + placebo, education + HMB, and education + placebo). Participants attended supervised RT sessions twice weekly or education programs every 2 wk and were provided calcium-HMB (1500 mg) or placebo supplements once daily for 12 wk. The main outcomes were changes in functional MQ, assessed by knee extension strength per quadriceps thickness, and compositional MQ, assessed by the echo intensity of the rectus femoris muscle. Overall, 156 and 149 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments, respectively. Two-factorial analysis of variance showed no significant interaction of HMB supplementation with RT in terms of functional or compositional MQ. Main-effects analyses revealed that the decline in functional MQ of the group performing RT was smaller by 0.71 N\u00b7mm-1 (95% confidence interval, 0.11-1.31) compared with that in the education group. No significant main effects of RT or HMB supplementation on compositional MQ were observed. HMB supplementation did not enhance the treatment effects of RT for either MQ parameter; however, RT reduced the decline in functional MQ. Thus, adding HMB supplementation to RT is not significantly useful for improving MQ in this population.",

          "content": "The use of ergogenic nutritional supplements is becoming inseparable from competitive sports. \u03b2-Hydroxy-\u03b2-Methylbutyric acid (HMB) has recently been suggested to promote fat-free mass (FFM) and strength gains during resistance training in adults. In this prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we studied the effect of HMB (3 g/day) supplementation on body composition, muscle strength, anaerobic and aerobic capacity, anabolic/catabolic hormones and inflammatory mediators in elite, national team level adolescent volleyball players (13.5-18 years, 14 males, 14 females, Tanner stage 4-5) during the first 7 weeks of the training season. HMB led to a significant greater increase in FFM by skinfold thickness (56.4 \u00b1 10.2 to 56.3 \u00b1 8.6 vs. 59.3 \u00b1 11.3 to 61.6 \u00b1 11.3 kg in the control and HMB group, respectively, p < 0.001). HMB led to a significant greater increase in both dominant and non-dominant knee flexion isokinetic force/FFM, measured at fast (180\u00b0/sec) and slow (60\u00b0/sec) angle speeds, but had no significant effect on knee extension and elbow flexion and extension. HMB led to a significant greater increase in peak and mean anaerobic power determined by the Wingate anaerobic test (peak power: 15.5 \u00b1 1.6 to 16.2 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 15.4 \u00b1 1.6 to 17.2 \u00b1 1.2 watts/FFM, mean power: 10.6 \u00b1 0.9 to 10.8 \u00b1 1.1 vs. 10.7 \u00b1 0.8 to 11.8 \u00b1 1.0 watts/FFM in control and HMB group, respectively, p < 0.01), with no effect on fatigue index. HMB had no significant effect on aerobic fitness or on anabolic (growth hormone, IGF-I, testosterone), catabolic (cortisol) and inflammatory mediators (IL-6 and IL-1 receptor antagonist). HMB supplementation was associated with greater increases in muscle mass, muscle strength and anaerobic properties with no effect on aerobic capacity suggesting some advantage for its use in elite adolescent volleyball players during the initial phases of the training season. These effects were not accompanied by hormonal and inflammatory mediator changes.",

Furthermore, to investigate if a conventional exercise training program, a subcategory of physical activity, could lower plasma BCAA along with alterations in IHL content in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and people with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). To investigate the effect of physical activity on the association between plasma BCAA and IHL content, linear regression analyses were performed in 1983 individuals from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) stratified by physical activity frequency. Furthermore, the effect of a 12-week supervised combined aerobic resistance-exercise program on plasma BCAA, insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), and IHL (proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS)) was investigated in seven patients with T2DM, seven individuals with NAFL and seven BMI-matched control participants (CON). We observed positive associations between plasma valine, isoleucine and leucine level, and IHL content (1.29 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.38), 1.52 (95% CI: 1.43, 1.61), and 1.54 (95% CI: 1.44, 1.64) times IHL, respectively, per standard deviation of plasma amino acid level). Similar associations were observed in less active versus more active individuals. Exercise training did not change plasma BCAA levels among groups, but reduced IHL content in NAFL (from 11.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0% pre-exercise to 8.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0% post exercise, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and CON (from 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6% pre-exercise to 1.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4% post exercise, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and improved peripheral insulin sensitivity in NAFL as well by ~23% (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The association between plasma BCAA levels and IHL is not affected by physical activity level. Exercise training reduced IHL without affecting plasma BCAA levels in individuals with NAFL and CON. We conclude that exercise training-induced reduction in IHL content is not related to changes in plasma BCAA levels. Trial registry number: NCT01317576.",

          "content": "This study aimed to determine the effect of postexercise protein-leucine coingestion with CHO-lipid on subsequent high-intensity endurance performance and to investigate candidate mechanisms using stable isotope methods and metabolomics. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 male cyclists ingested a leucine/protein/CHO/fat supplement (LEUPRO 7.5/20/89/22 g \u00b7 h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric CHO/fat control (119/22 g \u00b7 h(-1)) 1-3 h after exercise during a 6-d training block (intense intervals, recovery, repeated-sprint performance rides). Daily protein intake was clamped at 1.9 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (LEUPRO) and 1.5 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (control). Stable isotope infusions (1-(13)C-leucine and 6,6-(2)H2-glucose), mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and nitrogen balance methods were used to determine the effects of LEUPRO on whole-body branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and glucose metabolism and protein turnover. After exercise, LEUPRO increased BCAA levels in plasma (2.6-fold; 90% confidence limits = \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and urine (2.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.2) and increased products of BCAA metabolism plasma acylcarnitine C5 (3.0-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 0.9) and urinary leucine (3.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.3) and \u03b2-aminoisobutyrate (3.4-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.4), indicating that ingesting ~10 g leucine per hour during recovery exceeds the capacity to metabolize BCAA. Furthermore, LEUPRO increased leucine oxidation (5.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and nonoxidative disposal (4.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and left leucine balance positive relative to control. With the exception of day 1 (LEUPRO = 17 \u00b1 20 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = -90 \u00b1 44 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)), subsequent (days 2-5) nitrogen balance was positive for both conditions (LEUPRO = 130 \u00b1 110 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = 111 \u00b1 86 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)). Compared with control feeding, LEUPRO lowered the serum creatine kinase concentration by 21%-25% (90% confidence limits = \u00b1 14%), but the effect on sprint power was trivial (day 4 = 0.4% \u00b1 1.0%, day 6 = -0.3% \u00b1 1.0%). Postexercise protein-leucine supplementation saturates BCAA metabolism and attenuates tissue damage, but effects on subsequent intense endurance performance may be inconsequential under conditions of positive daily nitrogen balance.",

Therefore, a 24-week, prospective randomized open blinded-endpoint trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplementation of 8 g of BCAA or 7.5 g of soy protein on skeletal muscle and glycemic control as well as adverse events in elderly individuals with T2D. Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to the BCAA group ( = 21) and the soy protein group ( = 15). Skeletal muscle mass and HbA1c, which were primary endpoints, did not change over time or differ between groups. However, knee extension muscle strength was significantly increased in the soy protein group and showed a tendency to increase in the BCAA group. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance did not significantly change during the trial. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved in the BCAA group but the difference between groups was not significant. Results suggested that BCAA supplementation may not affect skeletal muscle mass and glycemic control and may improve depressive symptoms in elderly individuals with T2D.",

          "content": "The decline in cognitive performance has been shown after fatiguing exercise. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been suggested to alleviate exercise-induced central fatigue. Arginine and citrulline could remove the excess NH3 accumulation accompanied with BCAA supplementation by increasing nitric oxide biosynthesis and/or urea cycle. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the combined supplementation of BCAA, arginine, and citrulline on central fatigue after three simulated matches in well-trained taekwondo athletes. In a double-blind randomized cross-over design, 12 male taekwondo athletes performed two trials containing three simulated matches each. Each match contained three 2-min rounds of high-intensity intermittent exercise. At the end of the second match, two different supplementations were consumed. In the AA trial, the subjects ingested 0.17\u00a0g/kg BCAA, 0.05\u00a0g/kg arginine and 0.05\u00a0g/kg citrulline, while placebo was consumed in the PL trial. A validated taekwondo-specific reaction test battery was used to measure the cognitive performance after each match. The premotor reaction time in the three single-task tests and the reaction time in the secondary task in the dual-task test were maintained in the AA trial after three matches, while they were impaired in the PL trial, resulting in significantly better performance in the AA trial. These improvements in the AA trial coincided with significantly lower plasma free tryptophan/BCAA ratio, increased NOx concentrations, and similar NH3 concentrations. This study suggested that the combined supplementation could alleviate the exercise-induced central fatigue in elite athletes.",

We sought to identify biomarkers predictive of type 2 diabetes remission and amount of weight loss in individuals with severe obesity enrolled in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) and the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) studies. Targeted mass spectrometry-based profiling of 135 metabolites was performed in pre-intervention blood samples using a nested design for diabetes remission over five years (n\u2009=\u200993 LABS, n\u2009=\u200980 Look AHEAD; n\u2009=\u200987 remitters), and for extremes of weight loss at five years (n\u2009=\u2009151 LABS; n\u2009=\u200975 with high weight loss). Principal components analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, with PCA-derived metabolite factors tested for association with both diabetes remission and weight loss. Metabolic markers were tested for incremental improvement to clinical models, including the DiaRem score. Two metabolite factors were associated with diabetes remission: one primarily composed of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and tyrosine (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) [OR (95% CI)]\u2009=\u20091.4 [1.0-1.9], p\u2009=\u20090.045), and one with betaine and choline (OR [95% CI]\u2009=\u20090.7 [0.5-0.9], p\u2009=\u20090.02).These results were not significant after adjustment for multiple tests. Inclusion of these two factors in clinical models yielded modest improvements in model fit and performance: in a constructed clinical model, the C-statistic improved from 0.87 to 0.90 (p\u2009=\u20090.02), while the net reclassification index showed improvement in prediction compared to the DiaRem score (NRI\u2009=\u20090.26, p\u2009=\u20090.0013). No metabolite factors associated with weight loss at five years. Baseline levels of metabolites in the BCAA and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)-microbiome-related pathways are independently and incrementally associated with sustained diabetes remission after weight loss interventions in individuals with severe obesity. These metabolites could serve as clinically useful biomarkers to identify individuals who will benefit the most from weight loss interventions.",

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of 16 weeks branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) supplementation on frailty in frail compensated cirrhotic patients. After a 4-week run-in period consisted of dietary and exercise counseling, compensated cirrhotic patients with frailty, defined by liver frailty index (LFI)\u22654.5, were randomly assigned (1:1) to BCAA or control group. The BCAA group received twice daily BCAAs supplementation (210\u00a0kcal, protein 13.5\u00a0g, BCAA 2.03\u00a0g) for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was frailty reversion. The secondary outcomes were changes in biochemistries, body composition evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and quality of life (QoL). 54 patients were prospectively enrolled (age 65.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.9 years, 51.9% female, Child-Pugh A/B 68.5%/31.5%, MELD 10.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1).

Regarding the QoL, only the BCAA group had a significant improvement in all 4 domains of physical component score of the SF-36 questionnaire. A 16-week BCAA supplementation improved frailty in frail compensated cirrhotic patients. In addition, this intervention resulted in an improvement of muscle mass and physical domain of QoL in these patients.

          "content": "Sarcopenia is associated with adverse outcomes in cirrhosis. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) target several pathways that lead to muscle loss in this population. We aimed to evaluate the impact of BCAA supplementation on sarcopenia measures in patients with cirrhosis. We conducted a 12-month double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial of BCAA supplementation (30\u2009g daily) compared to an equicaloric, equi-nitrogenous whey protein in volunteers with cirrhosis and reduced muscle strength. The primary endpoint was an increase in grip strength and upper limb lean mass measured on DEXA. Mean-adjusted differences (MAD, 95% CI) between groups at 6 and 12 months are reported as treatment effect using a linear mixed model for repeated measures. A total of 150 volunteers entered the trial (74 BCAA, 76 control), with a median age of 58\u2009years [IQR 48; 63] and MELD of 14 [12; 17]. At 12 months, 57% in the BCAA arm and 61% in the control arm met the primary endpoint (p\u2009=\u20090.80). No significant between-group difference was found in grip strength (MAD -0.15\u2009kg [-0.37; 0.06], p\u2009=\u20090.29) or upper limb lean mass (1.7\u2009kg [-0.2; 3.6], p\u2009=\u20090.22) at 12 months. No significant differences in other body composition parameters, physical performance, frailty, rates of hospitalisation or mortality were found between the BCAA and the control group. Fatigue improved across the entire cohort, without significant between-group differences. 15% of volunteers reported side effects, with distaste higher in the BCAA arm (p\u2009=\u20090.045). BCAA supplementation did not improve measures of muscle strength, mass or performance or physical frailty compared to a whey protein supplement in a randomised controlled setting.

          "content": "The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation taken before or after exercise on delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Fifteen young men (aged 21.5\u00b10.4 years) were given either BCAA (9.6 g\u00b7day-1) or placebo before and after exercise (and for 3 days prior to and following the exercise day) in three independent groups: the control group (placebo before and after exercise), the PRE group (BCAA before exercise and placebo after exercise), and the POST group (placebo before exercise and BCAA after exercise). Participants performed 30 repetitions of eccentric exercise with the non-dominant arm. DOMS, upper arm circumference (CIR), elbow range of motion (ROM), serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase, BCAA, and \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (3HMB) were measured immediately before and after the exercise and on the following 4 days. Serum BCAA and 3HMB concentrations increased significantly in the PRE group immediately after the exercise, recovering to baseline over the following days. In the days following the exercise day, DOMS, CIR, and ROM were significantly improved in the PRE group compared to the control group, with weaker effects in the POST group. Serum activities of CK, LDH, and aldolase in the days following the exercise day were significantly suppressed in the PRE group compared to control group. The present study confirmed that repeated BCAA supplementation before exercise had a more beneficial effect in attenuating DOMS and EIMD induced by eccentric exercise than repeated supplementation after exercise.",

This investigation aimed to determine FFM and plasma AA responses to military training, examine whether adaptations differ between male and female recruits, and explore potential associations between FFM and AA responses to training. Body composition and plasma AA levels were assessed in US Army recruits (n = 209, 118 males, 91 females) before (baseline) and every three weeks during basic combat training (BCT), a 10-week military training course. Body weight decreased in men but remained stable in women during BCT (sex-by-time interaction, P < 0.05). Fifty-eight percent of recruits gained FFM during BCT, with more (P < 0.05) females (88%) gaining FFM than males (36%). Total plasma AA increased (P < 0.05) during BCT, with greater (P < 0.05) increases observed in females (17%) then in males (4%). Essential amino acids (EAA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) were increased (P < 0.05) in females but did not change in males (sex-by-time interaction, P < 0.05). Independent of sex, changes in EAA (r = 0.34) and BCAA (r = 0.27) from baseline were associated with changes in FFM (P < 0.05); greater (P < 0.05) increases in AA concentrations were observed for those who gained FFM. Increases in FFM and plasma AA suggest that BCT elicits a more pronounced anabolic response in women compared to men, which may reflect sex-specific differences in the relative intensity of the combined training and physiological stimulus associated with BCT.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis determined whether the ergogenic effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) ameliorated markers of muscle damage and performance following strenuous exercise. In total, 25 studies were included, consisting of 479 participants (age 24.3 \u00b1 8.3 years, height 1.73 \u00b1 0.06 m, body mass 70.8 \u00b1 9.5 kg, females 26.3%). These studies were rated as fair to excellent following the PEDro scale. The outcome measures were compared between the BCAA and placebo conditions at 24 and 48 hours following muscle-damaging exercises, using standardised mean differences and associated -values via forest plots. Our meta-analysis demonstrated significantly lower levels of indirect muscle damage markers (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and myoglobin) at 48 hours post-exercise (standardised mean difference [SMD] = -0.41;  < 0.05) for the BCAA than placebo conditions, whilst muscle soreness was significant at 24 hours post-exercise (SMD = -0.28 \u2264  \u2264 -0.61;  < 0.05) and 48 hours post-exercise (SMD = -0.41 \u2264 \u2264 -0.92;  < 0.01). However, no significant differences were identified between the BCAA and placebo conditions for muscle performance at 24 or 48 hours post-exercise (SMD = 0.08 \u2264  \u2264 0.21;  > 0.05). Overall, BCAA reduced the level of muscle damage biomarkers and muscle soreness following muscle-damaging exercises. However, the potential benefits of BCAA for muscle performance recovery is questionable and warrants further investigation to determine the practicality of BCAA for ameliorating muscle damage symptoms in diverse populations. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020191248.  BCAA reduces the level of creatine kinase and muscle soreness following strenuous exercise with a dose-response relationship.

These alterations are considered to contribute to sarcopenia and hepatic encephalopathy and may relate to poor prognosis. Here, we cross-sectionally analyzed the association between plasma BCAA levels and the severity of ESLD and muscle function in participants of the liver transplant subgroup of TransplantLines, enrolled between January 2017 and January 2020. Plasma BCAA levels were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Physical performance was analyzed with a hand grip strength test, 4 m walking test, sit-to-stand test, timed up and go test, standing balance test and clinical frailty scale. We included 92 patients (65% men). The Child Pugh Turcotte classification was significantly higher in the lowest sex-stratified BCAA tertile compared to the highest tertile ( = 0.015). The times for the sit-to-stand (r = -0.352,  < 0.05) and timed up and go tests (r = -0.472,  < 0.01) were inversely correlated with total BCAA levels. In conclusion, lower circulating BCAA are associated with the severity of liver disease and impaired muscle function. This suggests that BCAA may represent a useful prognostic marker in the staging of liver disease severity.",

A total of 1302 subjects in the cohort study of the Huai'an Diabetes Prevention Program were divided into two groups according to whether NAFLD was present at baseline. The group without NAFLD at baseline was only followed up, and the group with NAFLD at baseline received diet and exercise interventions. Anthropometric and biochemical examinations were performed at baseline and at the end of 4\u00a0years for all subjects. Serum BCAA (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) levels were measured by hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The associations of baseline serum BCAA levels with the risk for NAFLD, coronary heart disease (CHD), and cardiovascular events (CVEs) after 4\u00a0years were further evaluated. (1) At baseline and after the 4-year follow-up, baseline serum leucine, valine, and total BCAAs in the NAFLD group were significantly higher than those in the non-NAFLD group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). (2) According to whether NAFLD was present at baseline and after follow-up, all subjects were divided into four groups, including the control group, new case group, improvement group, and unchanged group. There was no significant difference in baseline BCAAs levels between the new case group and the improvement group (p\u2009>\u20090.05). (3) Risk factors for the occurrence and development of NAFLD were analysed by a multiple logistic regression model according to whether NAFLD existed at baseline. Serum leucine (OR\u2009=\u20091.058, 95% CI 1.005-1.114, p\u2009=\u20090.033) and total BCAAs (OR\u2009=\u20091.023, 95% CI 1.001-1.046, p\u2009=\u20090.045) were independent risk factors for new-onset NAFLD. Serum valine (OR\u2009=\u20091.131, 95% CI 1.043-1.226, p\u2009=\u20090.003), and total BCAAs (OR\u2009=\u20091.040, 95% CI 1.003-1.078, p\u2009=\u20090.035) were independent risk factors showing that NAFLD could not be reversed. (4) The cross-table Chi-square test showed that the incidence of both CHD and CVEs was significantly highest in the new case group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). (5) After adjusting for confounding factors, baseline isoleucine, valine, and BCAA levels were independently associated with new-onset CHD in subjects with or without NAFLD at baseline (p\u2009<\u20090.05). High BCAA levels exacerbate the risk of CHD and CVEs by influencing the occurrence and progression of NAFLD. However, lifestyle interventions could reverse the risk of NAFLD, CHD and CVEs associated with BCAAs.",

          "title": "Head Injury Treatment With Healthy and Advanced Dietary Supplements: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of the Tolerability, Safety, and Efficacy of Branched Chain Amino Acids in the Treatment of Concussion in Adolescents and Young Adults.",
          "content": "Concussion is a common injury in the adolescent and young adult populations. Although branched chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation has shown improvements in neurocognitive and sleep function in pre-clinical animal models of mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), to date, no studies have been performed evaluating the efficacy of BCAAs in concussed adolescents and young adults. The goal of this pilot trial was to determine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of varied doses of oral BCAA supplementation in a group of concussed adolescents and young adults. The study was conducted as a pilot, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of participants ages 11-34 presenting with concussion to outpatient clinics (sports medicine and primary care), urgent care, and emergency departments of a tertiary care pediatric children's hospital and an urban tertiary care adult hospital, between June 24, 2014 and December 5, 2020. Participants were randomized to one of five study arms (placebo and 15\u2009g, 30\u2009g, 45\u2009g, and 54\u2009g BCAA treatment daily) and followed for 21 days after enrollment. Outcome measures included daily computerized neurocognitive tests (processing speed, the  primary outcome; and attention, visual learning, and working memory), symptom score, physical and cognitive activity, sleep/wake alterations, treatment compliance, and adverse events. In total, 42 participants were randomized, 38 of whom provided analyzable data. We found no difference in our primary outcome of processing speed between the arms; however, there was a significant reduction in total symptom score (decrease of 4.4 points on a 0-54 scale for every 500\u2009g of study drug consumed,  value for trend\u2009=\u20090.0036, [uncorrected]) and return to physical activity (increase of 0.503 points on a 0-5 scale for every 500\u2009g of study drug consumed,  value for trend\u2009=\u20090.005 [uncorrected]). There were no serious adverse events. Eight of 38 participants reported a mild (not interfering with daily activity) or moderate (limitation of daily activity) adverse event; there were no differences in adverse events by arm, with only two reported mild adverse events (both gastrointestinal) in the highest (45\u2009g and 54\u2009g) BCAA arms. Although limited by slow enrollment, small sample size, and missing data, this study provides the first demonstration of efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability, of BCAAs in concussed adolescents and young adults; specifically, a dose-response effect in reducing concussion symptoms and a return to baseline physical activity in those treated with higher total doses of BCAAs. These findings provide important preliminary data to inform a larger trial of BCAA therapy to expedite concussion recovery.",

Twelve male volleyballers were randomly assigned to a BCAA group (n = 6) or a control group (n = 6). The BCAA group ingested 21 g over a week, 7 g per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, before a volleyball training session, while the control group drank a placebo drink. Participants performed 8 maximal countermovement jumps (CMJ); the 3 CMJs on Monday and Wednesday were evaluated after warm-up, after plyometric training, and at the end of the training session; and the 2 CMJs on Friday were evaluated after warm-up, and at the end of the training session. Compared with baseline, no significant differences in CMJ over the week were observed in BCAA or control group, neither between groups. The results indicated that 21 g of BCAA supplementation over a week did not improve vertical jump performance in professional volleyball players.",

          "content": "Coingestion of ketone salts, caffeine and the amino acids, taurine, and leucine improves endurance exercise performance. However, there is no study comparing this coingestion to the same nutrients without caffeine. We assessed whether ketone salts-caffeine-taurine-leucine (KCT) supplementation was superior to caffeine-free ketone salts-taurine-leucine supplementation (KT), or to an isoenergetic carbohydrate placebo (CHO-PLAC). Thirteen recreationally active men (mean \u00b1 SD: 177.5 \u00b1 6.1\u00a0cm, 75.9 \u00b1 4.6\u00a0kg, 23 \u00b1 3 years, 12.0 \u00b1 5.1% body fat) completed a best effort 20-km cycling time-trial, followed 15\u00a0min later by a Wingate power cycle test, after supplementing with either KCT (approximately 7\u00a0g of beta-hydroxybutyrate, approximately 120\u00a0mg of caffeine, 2.1\u00a0g of leucine, and 2.7\u00a0g of taurine), KT (i.e.,\u00a0same supplement without caffeine), or isoenergetic CHO-PLAC (11\u00a0g of dextrose). Blood ketones were elevated (p < .001) after ingestion of both KCT (0.65 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0mmol/L) and KT (0.72 \u00b1 0.31\u00a0mmol/L) relative to CHO-PLAC (0.06 \u00b1 0.05\u00a0mmol/L). Moreover, KCT improved (p < .003) 20-km cycling time-trial performance (37.80 \u00b1 2.28\u00a0min), compared with CHO-PLAC (39.40 \u00b1 3.33\u00a0min) but not versus KT (38.75 \u00b1 2.87\u00a0min; p < .09). 20-km cycling time-trial average power output was greater with KCT (power output = 180.5 \u00b1 28.7\u00a0W) versus both KT (170.9 \u00b1 31.7\u00a0W; p = .049) and CHO-PLAC (164.8 \u00b1 34.7\u00a0W; p = .001). Wingate peak power output was also greater for both KCT (1,134 \u00b1 137\u00a0W; p = .031) and KT (1,132 \u00b1 128\u00a0W; p = .039) versus CHO-PLAC (1,068 \u00b1 127\u00a0W). These data suggest that the observed improved exercise performance effects of this multi-ingredient supplement containing beta-hydroxybutyrate salts, taurine, and leucine are attributed partially to the addition of caffeine.",

          "content": "Taurine has been demonstrated to regulate and improve metabolic health. However, physiological and pathological differences among individuals with overweight or obesity may result in varied responses to taurine supplementation. This study aims to estimate the effects of long-term taurine supplementation on blood lipids, glycemia, and insulin sensitivity in adults with overweight or obesity through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The literature search was based on six databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, and SPORTDiscus) up to October 2024. Subgroup analyses were performed based on daily taurine intake dosage (<3 g or 3 g), overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m), and obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m). The final number of studies that met the inclusion criteria was 9 RCTs. The overall analysis showed that taurine supplementation significantly decreased TG (WMD = -0.56 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.92 to -0.2,  = 0.002,  = 63%), TC (WMD = -0.71 mg/dL, 95% CI: -1.17 to -0.25,  = 0.002,  = 73%), and fasting insulin (WMD = -2.15 \u00b5U/mL, 95% CI: -3.24 to -1.06,  = 0.0001,  = 9%). In the subgroup analysis, long-term taurine intake led to BMI improvement in overweight adults (WMD = -1.14 kg/m, 95% CI: -1.81 to -0.47,  = 0.0008,  = 0%). Meanwhile, improvements in HbA1c (WMD = -0.33%, 95% CI: -0.53 to -0.12,  = 0.002,  = 16%) and HOMA-IR (WMD = -0.91, 95% CI: -1.74 to -0.08,  = 0.003,  = 54%) were observed only in obese participants following taurine supplementation. Additionally, the long-term intake of 3 g of taurine significantly improved HbA1c (WMD = -0.37%, 95% CI: -0.61 to -0.13,  = 0.003,  = 0%) and FPG levels (WMD = -7.14 mg/dL, 95% CI: -12.53 to -1.74,  = 0.003,  = 70%) in overweight/obesity. Long-term taurine supplementation is particularly effective in improving glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in obesity. Furthermore, higher doses of taurine (3 g per day) demonstrate even greater improvements in glycemic control.",

          "content": "We aimed to investigate the effects of an 8-week total-body resistance exercise (TRX) suspension training intervention combined with taurine supplementation on body composition, blood glucose, and lipid markers in T2D females. Forty T2D middle-aged females (age: 53 \u00b1 5 years, body mass = 84.3 \u00b1 5.1 kg) were randomly assigned to four groups, TRX suspension training + placebo (TP;  = 10), TRX suspension training + taurine supplementation (TT;  = 10), taurine supplementation (T;  = 10), or control (C;  = 10). Body composition (body mass, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BFP)), blood glucose (fasting blood sugar (FBS)), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), Insulin, and Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and lipid markers (low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC)) were evaluated prior to and after interventions. All three interventions significantly decreased body mass, BMI, and BFP with no changes between them for body mass and BMI; however, BFP changes in the TT group were significantly greater than all other groups. FBS was significantly reduced in TP and TT. Insulin concentrations' decrement were significantly greater in all experimental groups compared to C; however, no between group differences were observed between TT, TP, and T. In regards to HOMA-IR, decreases in TT were significantly greater than all other groups TG, HbA1c, and LDL were reduced following all interventions. HDL values significantly increased only in the TT group, while TC significantly decreased in TP and TT groups. Changes in HbA1c, TG, HDL, and TC were significantly greater in the TT compared to all other groups. TRX training improved glycemic and lipid profiles, while taurine supplementation alone failed to show hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties. Notably, the synergic effects of TRX training and taurine supplementation were shown in HbA1c, HOMA-IR, TG, TC, HDL, and BFP changes. Our outcomes suggest that TRX training + taurine supplementation may be an effective adjuvant therapy in individuals with T2D.",

          "title": "Functional Role of Taurine in Aging and Cardiovascular Health: An Updated Overview.",
          "content": "Taurine, a naturally occurring sulfur-containing amino acid, has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its potential health benefits. Found in various foods and often used in energy drinks and supplements, taurine has been studied extensively to understand its impact on human physiology. Determining its exact functional roles represents a complex and multifaceted topic. We provide an overview of the scientific literature and present an analysis of the effects of taurine on various aspects of human health, focusing on aging and cardiovascular pathophysiology, but also including athletic performance, metabolic regulation, and neurological function. Additionally, our report summarizes the current recommendations for taurine intake and addresses potential safety concerns. Evidence from both human and animal studies indicates that taurine may have beneficial cardiovascular effects, including blood pressure regulation, improved cardiac fitness, and enhanced vascular health. Its mechanisms of action and antioxidant properties make it also an intriguing candidate for potential anti-aging strategies.",

Following an over night fast, participants completed a 5-min 60\u2009Watt warm-up followed by a 30-s Wingate anaerobic test on a cycle ergometer after ingestion of either 2\u2009g taurine (LOWTAU), 4\u2009g (MODTAU), 6\u2009g (HIGHTAU) or placebo (PLA) 1 h before the test. Peak (PP) and mean power (MP) along with heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), capillary lactate and blood glucose were measured. LOWTAU did not affect PP, MP, HR, lactate and glucose compared to PLA (\u2009>\u20090.05), while MODTAU improved MP and HIGHTAU improved PP and MP compared to PLA and LOWTAU (\u2009<\u20090.05). MODTAU and HIGHTAU had little effect on HR, blood lactate and glucose (\u2009>\u20090.05). A single dose of taurine (MODTAU or HIGHTAU) 1\u2009h prior to competition or training would provide an ergogenic effect on subsequent power output.",

          "content": "We compared the metabolomic profile of aqueous humor from patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG; n = 26) with that of a group of age- and sex-matched non-POAG controls (n = 26), all participants undergoing cataract surgery. Supervised paired partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed good predictive performance for test sets with a median area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.89 and a p-value of 0.0087. Twenty-three metabolites allowed discrimination between the two groups. Univariate analysis after the Benjamini-Hochberg correction showed significant differences for 13 of these metabolites. The POAG metabolomic signature indicated reduced concentrations of taurine and spermine and increased concentrations of creatinine, carnitine, three short-chain acylcarnitines, 7 amino acids (glutamine, glycine, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, hydroxyl-proline, and acetyl-ornithine), 7 phosphatidylcholines, one lysophosphatidylcholine, and one sphingomyelin. This suggests an alteration of metabolites involved in osmoprotection (taurine and creatinine), neuroprotection (spermine, taurine, and carnitine), amino acid metabolism (7 amino acids and three acylcarnitines), and the remodeling of cell membranes drained by the aqueous humor (hydroxyproline and phospholipids). Five of these metabolic alterations, already reported in POAG plasma, concern spermine, C3 and C4 acylcarnitines, PC aa 34:2, and PC aa 36:4, thus highlighting their importance in the pathogenesis of glaucoma.",

J Strength Cond Res 34(12): 3475-3481, 2020-This study investigated the effects of caffeine and taurine coingestion on repeat-sprint cycling performance and associated physiological and perceptual responses. In a double-blind, cross-over, repeated measures study, 11 male subjects (age 21 \u00b1 2 years; stature 178 \u00b1 7 cm; body mass 80 \u00b1 13 kg) completed 10 \u00d7 6-second sprints on a cycle ergometer, each separated by 24 seconds, one hour after ingesting: caffeine (80 mg) and taurine (1 g), equivalent to the amount observed in popular commercial energy drinks, or placebo (maltodextrin \u223c1 g) in a gelatine capsule. Performance was measured on a cycle ergometer, whereas blood lactate concentration (B[la]), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and heart rate (HR) were measured at baseline (pre-exercise) and after sprints 5 and 10. Magnitude-based inferences revealed likely, trivial differences in peak power and unclear, trivial intersprint fatigue index after ingestion of the caffeine and taurine supplement. Intrasprint fatigue was greater in the caffeine and taurine condition at sprint 10 (likely, small) and possibly smaller in sprints 6-9. The caffeine and taurine supplement had a likely large effect on HR at baseline (effect size = 0.94) and increases in B[la] after sprints 5 (likely small) and 10 (possibly small). There was no effect of the supplement on RPE (unclear, trivial). Administration of caffeine and taurine at doses equivalent to commercial energy drinks did not improve repeat-sprint cycling performance and seemed to induce greater fatigue within selected sprints, particularly at the end of the trial. This undesirable performance effect occurs in parallel with increased HR and glycolytic metabolic bi-products.",

          "content": "This study aimed to examine the effect of taurine ingestion on maximal voluntary muscle torque and power in trained male athletes with different caffeine habits. Fourteen male athletes 21.8 \u00b1 2.5 yr old were separated into caffeine and noncaffeine consumers to control for the effect of caffeine withdrawal on muscle function. On separate occasions, participants performed four isokinetic or three maximal isometric knee extensions with and without taurine (40 mg\u00b7kg body mass) after a double-blind, counterbalanced design. Muscle contractile performances were compared between the first sets as well as between the sets where these variables scored best. In response to isokinetic contraction, taurine treatment in the noncaffeine consumers resulted in a significant fall in first (-16.1%; P = 0.013) and best peak torque (-5.0%; P = 0.016) as well as in first (-17.7%; P = 0.015) and best power output (-8.0%; P = 0.008). In the caffeine consumers deprived of caffeine, taurine intake improved best power (5.2%; P = 0.045). With respect to the isometric variables, there was a significant decrease in the first (-5.1%; P = 0.002) and best peak torque (-4.3%; P = 0.032) in the noncaffeine group, but no effect in the group of caffeine consumers deprived of caffeine. Taurine ingestion increased blood taurine levels but had no effect on plasma amino acid levels. Taurine ingestion is detrimental to maximal voluntary muscle power and both maximal isokinetic and isometric peak torque in noncaffeine consumers, whereas taurine ingestion in caffeine-deprived caffeine consumers improves maximal voluntary muscle power but has no effect on other aspects of contractile performance.",

Different doses of taurine (TAU) (3 g or 6 g) or placebo were supplemented 90 minutes before a single bout of fasting aerobic exercise (on a treadmill at 60% of VO2 max). The subjects performed three trials, and each one was separated by seven days. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after the exercise protocol of each test to analyze plasma levels of glycerol and taurine. Lipid and carbohydrate oxidation were determined immediately after exercise for 15 minutes by indirect calorimetry. We observed that TAU supplementation (6 g) increased lipid oxidation (38%) and reduced the respiratory coefficient (4%) when compared to the placebo ( < 0.05). However, no differences in lipid oxidation were observed between the different doses of taurine (3 g and 6 g). For glycerol concentrations, there were no differences between trials. Six grams of TAU supplementation 90 minutes before a single bout of aerobic exercise in a fasted state was sufficient to increase the lipid oxidation post-exercise in healthy young men.",

To evaluate the effects of isolated oral taurine ingestion on endurance performance and to assess the contribution of (1) the dose and (2) the supplementation period to the ergogenic effect. A search was performed using various databases in September 2017. The studies were screened using search criteria for eligibility. Ten peer-reviewed articles were identified for inclusion.

The effects of (1) dose and (2) the acute (single dose) or chronic (> 1 day) supplementation periods were assessed using meta-regression. The doses of taurine ranged from 1 to 6\u00a0g/day and were provided in single doses and for up to 2\u00a0weeks among a range of subjects. Taurine ingestion improved overall endurance performance (Hedges' g\u00a0=\u00a00.40, 95% CI 0.12-0.67, P = 0.004), which was similar in TTE trials (Hedges' g = 0.43, 95% CI 0.12-0.75, P = 0.007).

In the first part of the study, after an overnight fast, 7 volunteers (28+/-3 yr, 184+/-2 cm, 88.0+/-6.6 kg) ingested 1.66 g oral taurine doses with breakfast (8 AM) and lunch (12 noon), and blood samples were taken throughout the day. In the second part of the study, eight men (22+/-1 yr, 181+/-1 cm, 80.9+/-3.8 kg, 4.21+/-0.16 l/min VO2peak) cycled for 2 h after 7 days of placebo (P) ingestion (6 g glucose/day) and again following 7 days of T (5 g/day). In the first part of the study, plasma taurine was 64+/-4 microM before T and rose rapidly to 778+/-139 microM by 10 AM and remained elevated at noon (359+/-56 microM). Plasma taurine reached 973+/-181 microM at 1 PM and was 161+/-31 microM at 4 PM. In the second part of the study, seven days of T had no effect on muscle taurine content (mmol/kg dry muscle) at rest (P, 44+/-15 vs. T, 42+/-15) or after exercise (P, 43+/-12 vs. T, 43+/-11). There was no difference in muscle glycogen or other muscle metabolites between conditions, but there were notable interaction effects for muscle valine, isoleucine, leucine, cystine, glutamate, alanine, and arginine amino acid content following exercise after T. These data indicate that 1) acute T produces a 13-fold increase in plasma taurine concentration; 2) despite the ability to significantly elevate plasma taurine for extended periods throughout the day, 7 days of T does not alter skeletal muscle taurine content or carbohydrate and fat oxidation during exercise; and 3) T appears to have some impact on muscle amino acid response to exercise.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the acute effects of a single dose of taurine supplementation on exercise performance and examined potential moderators related to participant characteristics, exercise modality, dosing, and administration protocols. Six electronic databases were searched up to July 2025, identifying 23 eligible randomized trials (k\u2009=\u200969, N\u2009=\u2009308). A three-level random-effects meta-analysis indicated that acute taurine ingestion may be associated with small-to-moderate improvements in overall performance (g\u2009=\u20090.25, 95% CI [0.10, 0.39], I\u2009=\u200961%). Moderator analyses suggested that benefits were more apparent in males and across aerobic endurance, strength/power, and agility/coordination tasks, whereas evidence for anaerobic capacity and muscular endurance remained inconsistent. No significant dose-response relationship was detected within the commonly used 1-6\u2009g range, suggesting potential threshold effects rather than linear trends. Both capsule and beverage formulations appeared effective, and nonlinear meta-regression indicated that ingestion about 1\u2009h before exercise might yield the most favorable outcomes, although this timing effect was not robust in sensitivity analyses. Further analyses showed that several subgroup effects were attenuated after excluding influential studies, and prediction intervals frequently included the null, reflecting uncertainty in replicability. The overall certainty of evidence, assessed using GRADE, was rated low to very low due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias. Collectively, these findings suggest that acute single-dose taurine supplementation holds promise as an ergogenic aid, but its effectiveness likely varies depending on dosage, blinding procedures, and exercise context. Additional high-quality trials are needed to establish more definitive recommendations.",

The blood and urine samples were obtained from the elderly in the morning fasting state. Taurine concentrations in serum and urinary excretion were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Dietary intake data were collected using questionnaires, and analyzed by Computer Aided Nutritional analysis program (CAN-pro 4.0). Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 20.0. There were no significant differences in age and BMI (body mass index) between the elderly with dementia and the normal elderly, however, blood total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels of the elderly with dementia were relatively higher than the normal elderly. The elderly men with dementia took more lipid, riboflavin higher than the normal elderly men (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The elderly women with dementia took more nutrients except vitamin D, vitamin B and taurine than the normal elderly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There were slight differences in serum taurine level between the two groups. However, urinary excretion of taurine in the elderly with dementia was significantly higher than the normal elderly (41.2%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).",

Since taurine body content decreases with aging, we investigated the effects of supplementation (alone and combined with exercise) on oxidative stress, extracellular matrix degradation, white blood cells, neurotrophins, cognition and physical fitness of elderly women. Forty-eight women (83.58\u2009\u00b1\u20096.98\u00a0years) were enrolled into exercise training only (EO: n\u2009=\u200913), taurine supplementation (TS: n\u2009=\u200912), exercise training\u2009+\u2009taurine supplementation (ETTS: n\u2009=\u200911), and control group (CG: n\u2009=\u200912). All interventions lasted 14\u00a0weeks. Exercise was applied twice a week, and taurine was given once a day (1.5\u00a0g). Data collection occurred before and after interventions with the determination of myeloperoxidase (MPO), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF) levels, and white blood cell counts (WBC). Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and physical fitness tests were also evaluated. Concentration of MPO and MMP-9 decreased after intervention in TS (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No effect of time or time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0group was observed for WBC parameters; however, univariate analysis showed a significant decrease in lymphocytes for TS, while an increase in monocytes occurred in the CG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). MoCA scores decreased over time in the CG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Improvements in physical fitness occurred in ETTS (better agility and aerobic capacity), mostly likely due to exercise and boosted by taurine supplementation. No changes in BDNF levels were observed (p\u2009>\u20090.05), while NGF concentration were undetectable in almost subjects.

          "content": "There are many causes for carnitine depletion during maintenance hemodialysis. Supplementation with L-carnitine in animals has been associated with improvement in some abnormalities also present in chronic renal failure. However, it is still controversial whether restoring plasma or tissue carnitine will correct clinical or biologic symptoms observed in maintenance hemodialysis. A systematic review is here performed to determine the effects of L-carnitine in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Eighty-three prospective trials were identified from 1978 to 1999 in which L-carnitine was randomly allocated in 21 trials. Change in serum triglycerides, cholesterol fractions, hemoglobin levels, erythropoietin dose, and other symptoms (muscle function, exercise capacity, and quality of life) were examined. A total of 482 patients in 18 trials were considered for analysis. There was no effect of L-carnitine on triglycerides, total cholesterol, or any of its fractions. Before the erythropoietin (EPO) era, L-carnitine treatment was associated with improved hemoglobin (P < 0.01) and with a decreased EPO dose (P < 0.01) and improved resistance to EPO when patients routinely received EPO. Muscle function, exercise capacity, and quality of life could not be reliably assessed because of the noncombinable nature of end points and the limited number of trials. In conclusion, L-carnitine cannot be recommended for treating the dyslipidemia of maintenance hemodialysis patients. By contrast, this review suggests a promising effect of L-carnitine on anemia management. The route of L-carnitine administration should be evaluated because there is no evidence as to the most efficient method of administration in maintenance hemodialysis.",

Twenty-eight subjects (14 male; 14 female) exercised for 40 min on a bicycle ergometer at 55% of their maximal aerobic capacities. Blood samples were obtained at rest, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min of exercise, and 15-min postexercise. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were performed before and after exercise. Results demonstrated that the percent of acylated plasma carnitine increased significantly (P less than 0.05) across all subjects from 17.3% at rest to 22.3% by 40 min of exercise and continued to increase to 22.8% 15-min postexercise. Total muscle carnitine levels fell significantly (P less than 0.001) across all subjects from 4.21 (1.27) (means +/- SD) mumol/g wet weight at rest to 3.29 (1.27) mumol/g wet weight after exercise. Well-trained males and females had almost identical levels of muscle carnitine [4.35(1.86) and 4.34 (0.64) mumol/g wet weight, respectively]. These levels were somewhat higher but not significantly higher than their moderately trained counterparts [3.86(1.34) and 4.28(1.18) males and females, respectively]. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase (E.C. 2.3.1.21) activity also declined significantly (P less than 0.05) across all subjects after exercise. This study is the first to demonstrate a potential loss of acylated carnitine forms from muscle to plasma during acute exercise, possibly reflecting an increase in carnitine turnover. Alterations in carnitine status may represent another metabolic adaptation to chronic exercise training.",

A quantity of 2 g of L-carnitine or a placebo were administered orally in random order to these subjects 1 h before they began exercise on a cycle ergometer. Exercise intensity was increased by 50-W increments every 3 min until they became exhausted. After 72-h recovery, the same exercise regime was repeated but this time the subjects, who had previously received L-carnitine, were now given the placebo and vice versa. The results showed that at the maximal exercise intensity, treatment with L-carnitine significantly increased both maximal oxygen uptake, and power output. Moreover, at similar exercise intensities in the L-carnitine trial oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, pulmonary ventilation and plasma lactate were reduced. It is concluded that under these experimental conditions pretreatment with L-carnitine favoured aerobic processes resulting in a more efficient performance. Possible mechanisms producing this effect are discussed.",

Exercise induces health benefits, but acute exertion up-regulates oxidative stress responses in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on i) exercise performance and ii) blood redox status both at rest and after exercise. Twelve hemodialysis patients received either L-carnitine (20 mg kg(-1) i.v.) or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, and crossover design for 8 wk. Participants performed an exercise test to exhaustion before and after supplementation. During the test, V\u02d9O2, respiratory quotient, heart rate, and time to exhaustion were monitored. Blood samples, collected before and after exercise, were analyzed for lactate, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls, reduced and oxidized glutathione, antioxidant capacity, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity. Blood carnitine increased by L-carnitine supplementation proportionately at rest and after exercise. L-carnitine supplementation increased time to fatigue (22%) and decreased postexercise lactate (37%), submaximal heart rate, and respiratory quotient but did not affect V\u02d9O2peak. L-carnitine supplementation increased reduced/oxidized glutathione (2.7-fold at rest, 4-fold postexercise) and glutathione peroxidase activity (4.5% at rest, 10% postexercise) and decreased malondialdehyde (19% at rest and postexercise) and protein carbonyl (27% at rest, 40% postexercise) concentration.

          "content": "A double-blind, cross-over study was designed to evaluate the effects of L-carnitine in patients with peripheral vascular disease. After drug washout, 20 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or L-carnitine (2 g bid, orally) for a period of 3 weeks and were then crossed over to the other treatment for an additional 3 weeks. The effect on walking distance at the end of each treatment period was measured by treadmill test. Absolute walking distance rose from 174 +/- 63 m with placebo to 306 +/- 122 m (p less than .01) with carnitine. Biopsy of the ischemic muscle, carried out before and after 15 days of L-carnitine administration in four additional patients, showed that treatment significantly increased total carnitine levels. An additional goal of this study was to ascertain the effects of L-carnitine on the metabolic changes induced by exercise in the affected limb. In six patients under control conditions, arterial and popliteal venous lactate and pyruvate concentrations were determined at rest, when the maximal walking distance was reached, and 5 min after the walking test. Twenty-four hours later, L-carnitine was administered intravenously (3 g as a bolus followed by an infusion of 2 mg/kg/min for 30 min) and metabolic assessments were repeated. Five minutes after the walking test, popliteal venous lactate concentration increased by 107 +/- 16% before treatment and by only 54 +/- 32% (p less than .01) after carnitine. Furthermore, carnitine induced a more rapid recovery to the resting value of the lactate/pyruvate ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Measurements were made on venous blood samples collected during each experiment at fixed time intervals over an initial rest of 45 min, 60 min bicycle exercise performed near 50% VO2max and 120 min recovery. Free and total plasma carnitine levels reached a plateau corresponding to an average rise of 25% for both fractions, 9-10 days after the beginning of the L-carn diet. These levels returned to their initial values 6-8 weeks after cessation of the supply. Generally L-carn supplementation did not significantly modify the physiological parameters and circulating metabolites. No distinct increase of the relative participation of endogenous lipids in the fuel supply of prolonged submaximal exercise was observed. In normal human subjects the increased demand for fatty acid oxidation resulting from exercise seems to be adequately supported by endogenous levels of carnitine.",

          "content": "Two trials were conducted to investigate the effects of L-carnitine supplementation upon maximum and submaximum exercise capacity. Two groups of healthy, untrained subjects were studied in double-blind cross-over trails. Oral supplementation of 2 g per day L-carnitine was used for 2 weeks in the first trial and the same dose but for 4 weeks in the second trial. Maximum and submaximum exercise capacity were assessed during a continuous progressive cycle ergometer exercise test performed at 70 rpm. In trial 1, plasma concentrations of lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate were measured pre- and post-exercise. In trial 2, pre- and post-exercise plasma lactate were measured. The results of treatment with L-carnitine demonstrated no significant changes in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) or in maximum heart rate. In trial 1, there was a small improvement in submaximal performance as evidenced by a decrease in the heart-rate response to a work-load requiring 50% of VO2max. The more extensive trial 2 did not reproduce the significant result obtained in trial 1, that is, there was no significant decrease in heart rate at any given submaximal exercise intensity, under carnitine-supplemented conditions. Plasma metabolic concentrations were unchanged following L-carnitine, in both trials. It is concluded, that in contrast to other reports, carnitine supplementation may be of little benefit to exercise performance since the observed effects were small and inconsistent.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether three-week supplementation of L-glutamine could benefit the mucosal immunity and hormonal status of combat-sport athletes as well as their rates of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and subjective feelings of well-being after intensive training. Twenty-one combat-sport athletes from the National Taiwan University of Sport were recruited in this study. After intensive training, two groups of the participants were asked to consume powder form of 0.3\u2009g/kg body weight of L-glutamine (GLU group) or maltodextrin (PLA group) with drinking water in a randomized design at the same time every day during 3 weeks. Saliva samples were collected to measure immunoglobulin A (IgA), nitric oxide (NO), testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) before and after three-week supplementation; moreover, Hooper's index questionnaires were completed for wellness assessment. The incidence and duration of URTI were recorded by using a health checklist throughout the entire study period. Supplementation of L-glutamine significantly enhanced the concentrations of IgA and NO in saliva; additionally, the incidence of URTI was significantly reduced. Regarding hormones, T concentration was significantly decreased in the PLA group, whereas C concentration was significantly increased, resulting in a significant decrease of T/C ratio. In contrast, the GLU group showed a significant increase of T/C ratio, while the mood scores of the Hooper's index questionnaire were higher in the PLA group. Three-week supplementation of L-glutamine after intensive training enhanced the mucosal immunity, improved hormonal status and reduced the rate of URTI of combat-sport athletes while feelings of well-being were also enhanced. Therefore, L-glutamine would be beneficial for the sports performance and recovery of athletes.",

          "content": "Athletes often take sport supplements to reduce fatigue and immune disturbances during or after training. This study evaluated the acute effects of concurrent ingestion of alkaline water and L-glutamine on the salivary immunity and hormone responses of boxers after training. Twelve male boxing athletes were recruited in this study. During regular training, the participants were randomly divided into three groups and asked to consume 400 mL of alkaline water (Group A), 0.15 g/kg body weight of L-glutamine with 400 mL of water (Group G), and 0.15 g/kg of L-glutamine with 400 mL of alkaline water (Group A+G) at the same time each day for three consecutive weeks. Before and immediately after the training, saliva, heart rates, and the rate of perceived exertion were investigated. The activity of \u03b1-amylase and concentrations of lactoferrin, immunoglobulin A (IgA), testosterone, and cortisol in saliva were measured. The results showed that the ratio of \u03b1-amylase activity/total protein (TP) significantly increased after training in Group A+G but not in Group A or G, whereas the ratios of lactoferrin/TP and IgA/TP were unaffected in all three groups. The concentrations of salivary testosterone after training increased significantly in Group A+G but not in Group A or G, whereas the salivary cortisol concentrations were unaltered in all groups. In conclusion, concurrent ingestion of 400 mL of alkaline water and 0.15 g/kg of L-glutamine before training enhanced the salivary \u03b1-amylase activity and testosterone concentration of boxers, which would be beneficial for post-exercise recovery.",

A group of 31 subjects, aged 18-24 years, were randomly allocated to groups (double blind) to receive either glutamine (0.9 g x kg lean tissue mass(-1) x day(-1); n = 17) or a placebo (0.9 g maltodextrin x kg lean tissue mass(-1) x day(-1); n = 14 during 6 weeks of total body resistance training. Exercises were performed for four to five sets of 6-12 repetitions at intensities ranging from 60% to 90% 1 repetition maximum (1 RM). Before and after training, measurements were taken of 1 RM squat and bench press strength, peak knee extension torque (using an isokinetic dynamometer), lean tissue mass (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) and muscle protein degradation (urinary 3-methylhistidine by high performance liquid chromatography). Repeated measures ANOVA showed that strength, torque, lean tissue mass and 3-methylhistidine increased with training (P < 0.05), with no significant difference between groups. Both groups increased their 1 RM squat by approximately 30% and 1 RM bench press by approximately 14%. The glutamine group showed increases of 6% for knee extension torque, 2% for lean tissue mass and 41% for urinary levels of 3-methylhistidine. The placebo group increased knee extension torque by 5%, lean tissue mass by 1.7% and 3-methylhistidine by 56%. We conclude that glutamine supplementation during resistance training has no significant effect on muscle performance, body composition or muscle protein degradation in young healthy adults.",

          "content": "There is an increased risk of infections in athletes undertaking prolonged, strenuous exercise. There is also some evidence that cells of the immune system are less able to mount a defence against infections after such exercise. The level of plasma glutamine, an important fuel for cells of the immune system, is decreased in athletes after endurance exercise; this may be partly responsible for the apparent immunosuppression which occurs in these individuals. We monitored levels of infection in more than 200 runners and towers. The levels of infection were lowest in middle-distance runners, and highest in runners after a full or ultramarathon and in elite rowers after intensive training. In the present study, athletes participating in different types of exercise consumed two drinks, containing either glutamine (Group G) or placebo (Group P) immediately after and 2 h after exercise. They subsequently completed questionnaires (n = 151) about the incidence of infections during the 7 days following the exercise. The percentage of athletes reporting no infections was considerably higher in Group G (81%, n = 72) than in Group P (49%, n = 79, p < 0.001).",

          "content": "The premise of this study was to investigate the effect of acute glutamine supplementation on 20\u00a0km time trial cycling performance in the heat, neuromuscular function, inflammation and endotoxemia. Twelve cyclists completed two, 20-km time trials (20TT) in 35\u00a0\u00b0C (50% relative humidity). Participants ingested either glutamine (GLUT; 0.9\u00a0g kg fat-free mass) or a placebo (CON) 60\u00a0min before each 20TT. Physiological and perceptual measures were recorded during each 20TT, and neuromuscular function assessed pre- and post-exercise. Venous blood was analysed for endotoxins, markers of gut damage (inflammatory fatty acid binding protein; I-FABP) and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, IL-6; tumour necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-\u03b1). Data were analysed using linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework. 20TT in the heat increased I-FABP and elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) compared to pre-exercise values but did not result in endotoxemia. Completion time was not statistically different between conditions (mean difference [95% credible interval]\u2009=\u200911\u00a0s [-\u200923, 44]). Relative to CON, GLUT did not alter any physiological or perceptual measures during the 20TT. Glutamine supplementation does not improve 20TT performance in the heat or preserve neuromuscular function when compared to a placebo. These findings suggest that glutamine is not an ergogenic aid or prophylactic intervention for heat-induced gut damage during short-duration self-paced exercise in hot environments.",

          "content": "This study analyzed the effects of carbohydrate and glutamine supplementation on salivary immunity after exercise at a simulated altitude of 4500 m. Fifteen volunteers performed exercise of 70% of VO until exhaustion and were divided into three groups: hypoxia placebo, hypoxia 8% maltodextrin (200 mL/20 min), and hypoxia after six days glutamine (20 g/day) and 8% maltodextrin (200 mL/20 min). All procedures were randomized and double-blind. Saliva was collected at rest (basal), before exercise (pre-exercise), immediately after exercise (post-exercise), and two hours after exercise. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures and Tukey post hoc test were performed. Statistical significance was set at  < 0.05. SaO\u2082% reduced when comparing baseline vs. pre-exercise, post-exercise, and after recovery for all three groups. There was also a reduction of SaO\u2082% in pre-exercise vs. post-exercise for the hypoxia group and an increase was observed in pre-exercise vs. recovery for both supplementation groups, and between post-exercise and for the three groups studied. There was an increase of salivary flow in post-exercise vs. recovery in Hypoxia + Carbohydrate group. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) decreased from baseline vs. post-exercise for Hypoxia + Glutamine group. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) increased from post-exercise vs. after recovery in Hypoxia + Carbohydrate group. Reduction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) was observed from baseline vs. post-exercise and after recovery for the Hypoxia + Carbohydrate group; a lower concentration was observed in pre-exercise vs. post-exercise and recovery. TNF-\u03b1 had a reduction from baseline vs. post-exercise for both supplementation groups, and a lower secretion between baseline vs. recovery, and pre-exercise vs. post-exercise for Hypoxia + Carbohydrate group. Five hours of hypoxia and exercise did not change IgA. Carbohydrates, with greater efficiency than glutamine, induced anti-inflammatory responses.",

          "content": "Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in human muscle and plasma and is utilised at high rates by rapidly dividing cells, including leucocytes, to provide energy and optimal conditions for nucleotide biosynthesis. As such, it is considered to be essential for proper immune function. During various catabolic states including surgical trauma, infection, starvation and prolonged exercise, glutamine homeostasis is placed under stress. Falls in the plasma glutamine level (normal range 500 to 750 mumol/L after an overnight fast) have been reported following endurance events and prolonged exercise. These levels remain unchanged or temporarily elevated after short term, high intensity exercise. Plasma glutamine has also been reported to fall in patients with untreated diabetes mellitus, in diet-induced metabolic acidosis and in the recovery period following high intensity intermittent exercise. Common factors among all these stress states are rises in the plasma concentrations of cortisol and glucagon and an increased tissue requirement for glutamine for gluconeogenesis. It is suggested that increased gluconeogenesis and associated increases in hepatic, gut and renal glutamine uptake account for the depletion of plasma glutamine in catabolic stress states, including prolonged exercise. The short term effects of exercise on the plasma glutamine level may be cumulative, since heavy training has been shown to result in low plasma glutamine levels (< 500 mumol/L) requiring long periods of recovery. Furthermore, athletes experiencing discomfort from the overtraining syndrome exhibit lower resting levels of plasma glutamine than active healthy controls. Therefore, physical activity directly affects the availability of glutamine to the leucocytes and thus may influence immune function. The utility of plasma glutamine level as a marker of overtraining has recently been highlighted, but a consensus has not yet been reached concerning the best method of determining the level. Since injury, infection, nutritional status and acute exercise can all influence plasma glutamine level, these factors must be controlled and/or taken into consideration if plasma glutamine is to prove a useful marker of impending overtraining.",

However, during various catabolic states, such as infection, surgery, trauma and acidosis, glutamine homeostasis is placed under stress, and glutamine reserves, particularly in the skeletal muscle, are depleted. With regard to glutamine metabolism, exercise stress may be viewed in a similar light to other catabolic stresses. Plasma glutamine responses to both prolonged and high intensity exercise are characterised by increased levels during exercise followed by significant decreases during the post-exercise recovery period, with several hours of recovery required for restoration of pre-exercise levels, depending on the intensity and duration of exercise. If recovery between exercise bouts is inadequate, the acute effects of exercise on plasma glutamine level may be cumulative, since overload training has been shown to result in low plasma glutamine levels requiring prolonged recovery. Athletes suffering from the overtraining syndrome (OTS) appear to maintain low plasma glutamine levels for months or years. All these observations have important implications for organ functions in these athletes, particularly with regard to the gut and the cells of the immune system, which may be adversely affected. In conclusion, if methodological issues are carefully considered, plasma glutamine level may be useful as an indicator of an overtrained state.",

Falls in plasma glutamine concentration after exercise may have deleterious consequences for immune cell function and render the individual more susceptible to infection. The purpose of the present study was to examine changes in plasma glutamine concentration (measured using a validated enzymatic spectrophotometric method) following an acute bout of intermittent high-intensity exercise. Eight well-trained male games players took part in the study. Subjects reported to the laboratory following an overnight fast and performed a 1-h cycle exercise task consisting of 20 1-min periods at 100% maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) each separated by 2 min of recovery at 30% VO2max. Venous blood samples were taken before exercise and at 5 min, 1 h, 2.5 h, 5 h and 24 h post-exercise. Glutamine was measured by enzymatic spectrophotometric determination of the ammonia concentration before and after treatment of the plasma with glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2). Plasma glutamine concentration did not fall in the immediate post-exercise period [pre-exercise 681 (23) microM compared with 663 (46) microM at 5 min post-exercise, mean (SEM)], but fell to 572 (35) microM at 5 h post-exercise (P < 0.05 compared with pre-exercise). Plasma lactate concentration rose to 8.8 (1.0) mM at the end of exercise and fell to 1.8 (0.4) mM at 1 h post-exercise, but plasma concentrations of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate both rose substantially in the post-exercise period (to 240% and 400% of pre-exercise levels, respectively). The circulating leucocyte count increased significantly during exercise (P < 0.01), continued to increase in the hours following exercise and peaked at 2.5 h post-exercise (mainly due to a neutrophilia). The fall in the plasma glutamine concentration at 5 h post-exercise could be due to increased renal uptake of glutamine, which generally occurs in conditions of metabolic acidosis or due to a greater removal of glutamine from the plasma resulting from the elevated circulating leucocyte count.",

Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data related to body mass, lean body mass, body fat percentage, Vo2 max, lymphocytes, leukocytes and neutrophil counts were extracted to determine the effects of GLN on performance outcomes. The literature search was conducted across the databases Pubmed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, SID (Scientific Information Database) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, covering a period up to January 2017. Clinical trials evaluating glutamine supplementation outcomes on athletes aged over 18 were included. A total of 47 studies were included in the systematic review, and 25 trials matched the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. According to the meta-analysis, glutamine has a significant effect on weight reduction (WMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.36 [95% CI:\u00a0-2.55 to\u00a0-0.16], p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Moreover, neutrophil numbers were reduced following glutamine intake at doses greater than 200\u00a0mg/kg body weight (WMD\u00a0=\u00a0-605.77 [95% CI:\u00a0-1200.0 to 52.1]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Also, supplementation by glutamine dipeptide resulted in higher blood glucose after exercise (WMD\u00a0=\u00a00.51 [95% CI: 0.18, 0.83] mmol/l; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). There was no association between glutamine ingestion and other outcomes investigated. According to this meta-analysis, generally, glutamine supplementation has no effect on athletics immune system, aerobic performance, and body composition. However, the current study showed that glutamine resulted in greater weight reduction. In addition, the present study suggests that the efficacy of glutamine supplementation on neutrophil numbers could be affected by supplement type and dose.",

          "title": "Glutamine supplementation reduces markers of intestinal permeability during running in the heat in a dose-dependent manner.",
          "content": "To examine the dose-response effects of acute glutamine supplementation on markers of gastrointestinal (GI) permeability, damage and, secondary, subjective symptoms of GI discomfort in response to running in the heat. Ten recreationally active males completed a total of four exercise trials; a placebo trial and three glutamine trials at 0.25, 0.5 and 0.9 g\u00a0kg of fat-free mass (FFM) consumed 2\u00a0h before exercise. Each exercise trial consisted of a 60-min treadmill run at 70% of [Formula: see text] in an environmental chamber set at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. GI permeability was measured using ratio of lactulose to rhamnose (L:R) in serum. Plasma glutamine and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) concentrations were determined pre and post exercise. Subjective GI symptoms were assessed 45\u00a0min and 24\u00a0h post-exercise. Relative to placebo, L:R was likely lower following 0.25 g kg (mean difference: -\u00a00.023; \u00b1\u00a00.021) and 0.5 g\u00a0kg (-\u00a00.019; \u00b1\u00a00.019) and very likely following 0.9 g\u00a0kg (-\u00a00.034; \u00b1\u00a00.024). GI symptoms were typically low and there was no effect of supplementation. Acute oral glutamine consumption attenuates GI permeability relative to placebo even at lower doses of 0.25 g\u00a0kg, although larger doses may be more effective. It remains unclear if this will lead to reductions in GI symptoms. Athletes competing in the heat may, therefore, benefit from acute glutamine supplementation prior to exercise in order to maintain gastrointestinal integrity.",

          "content": "Skeletal muscle, as a producer of glutamine, is important for lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. Exercise-induced muscle damage could burden the immune system by concurrently eliciting a local inflammatory response and decreasing glutamine availability. The aim of this study was to determine whether blood leukocyte and glutamine concentrations were affected in individuals with high serum creatine kinase (CK) activity (indirect indication of muscle damage) compared to those with no change in CK. Twelve females performed maximal eccentric resistance exercise using one arm and one leg. Blood leukocyte subsets and glutamine were measured at 24 and 0 h pre-exercise, and post-exercise at intervals up to 9 d post-exercise. Eleven subjects were placed in High (n = 6) and Low CK (n = 5) groups. Lymphocytes, (total, natural killer, and T), monocytes, and granulocytes did not change significantly in either group, at any time. Whole blood glutamine concentration decreased (p < 0.05) from 437 microM pre-exercise to 332 microM 3 d post-exercise in both groups. The decrease in glutamine suggests that the metabolism of the muscle may be affected by this exercise, however, the occurrence of this decrease in both groups suggests that this change was not a response to muscle damage.",

This study examined the possibility of abolishing the exercise-induced decrease in salivary IgA through glutamine supplementation during and after intense exercise.

Glutamine (a total of 17.5 g), protein (a total of 68.5 g/6.2 g protein-bound glutamine), and placebo supplements were given during and up to 2 h after exercise. Unstimulated, timed saliva samples were obtained before exercise and 20 min, 140 min, 4 h, and 22 h postexercise. The exercise protocol induced a decrease in salivary IgA (IgA concentration, IgA output, and IgA relative to total protein). The plasma concentration of glutamine was decreased by 15% 2 h postexercise in the placebo group, whereas this decline was abolished by both glutamine and protein supplements. None of the supplements, however, was able to abolish the decline in salivary IgA.

Resting plasma glutamine concentration was measured in five groups of eight distance runners, competitive swimmers, cyclists, powerlifters, and nonathletes. Dietary protein intake of each subject was measured (g.d-1 and g.kg-1.d-1). Plasma glutamine concentration was significantly different between sports (P = 0.000, ANOVA) with mean plasma glutamine concentration of cyclists significantly higher than in all other groups, and mean plasma glutamine concentration of powerlifters and swimmers significantly lower than in cyclists and nonathletes (P < 0.05, post hoc analysis). There was no significant relationship between plasma glutamine concentration and total dietary protein intake when expressed as g.d-1 (r = 0.11, P > 0.05); however, plasma glutamine concentration and dietary protein relative to body mass (g.kg-1.d-1) were significantly inversely correlated (r = -0.37, P = 0.007). These data suggest that resting plasma glutamine concentration may vary between sports, possibly due to metabolic demands of the different sports; dietary factors may also affect plasma glutamine concentration.",

          "content": "Leucine is a key amino acid involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis. We assessed the effect of the supplementation of a lower-protein mixed macronutrient beverage with varying doses of leucine or a mixture of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) on myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) at rest and after exercise. In a parallel group design, 40 men (21 \u00b1 1 y) completed unilateral knee-extensor resistance exercise before the ingestion of 25 g whey protein (W25) (3.0 g leucine), 6.25 g whey protein (W6) (0.75g leucine), 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine to 3.0 g total leucine (W6+Low-Leu), 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine to 5.0 g total leucine (W6+High-Leu), or 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine, isoleucine, and valine to 5.0 g total leucine. A primed continuous infusion of l-[ring-(13)C6] phenylalanine with serial muscle biopsies was used to measure MPS under baseline fasted and postprandial conditions in both a rested (response to feeding) and exercised (response to combined feeding and resistance exercise) leg. The area under the blood leucine curve was greatest for the W6+High-Leu group compared with the W6 and W6+Low-Leu groups (P < 0.001). In the postprandial period, rates of MPS were increased above baseline over 0-1.5 h in all treatments. Over 1.5-4.5 h, MPS remained increased above baseline after all treatments but was greatest after W25 (\u223c267%) and W6+High-Leu (\u223c220%) treatments (P = 0.002). A low-protein (6.25 g) mixed macronutrient beverage can be as effective as a high-protein dose (25 g) at stimulating increased MPS rates when supplemented with a high (5.0 g total leucine) amount of leucine. These results have important implications for formulations of protein beverages designed to enhance muscle anabolism. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 1530646.",

          "content": "Whey protein and leucine ingestion following exercise increases muscle protein synthesis and could influence neutrophil function during recovery from prolonged intense exercise. We examined the effects of whey protein and leucine ingestion post-exercise on neutrophil function and immunomodulators during a period of intense cycling. In a randomized double-blind crossover, 12 male cyclists ingested protein/leucine/carbohydrate/fat (LEUPRO 20/7.5/89/22 g h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric carbohydrate/fat control (CON 119/22 g h(-1)) beverages for 1-3 h post-exercise during 6 days of high-intensity training. Blood was taken pre- and post-exercise on days 1, 2, 4 and 6 for phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated neutrophil superoxide (O2 (-)) production, immune cell counts, amino acid and lipid metabolism via metabolomics, hormones (cortisol, testosterone) and cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-10). During recovery on day 1, LEUPRO ingestion increased mean concentrations of plasma amino acids (glycine, arginine, glutamine, leucine) and myristic acid metabolites (acylcarnitines C14, myristoylcarnitine; and C14:1-OH, hydroxymyristoleylcarnitine) with neutrophil priming capacity, and reduced neutrophil O2 production (15-17 mmol O2 (-) cell(-1) \u00b1 90 % confidence limits 20 mmol O2 (-) cell(-1)). On day 2, LEUPRO increased pre-exercise plasma volume (6.6 \u00b1 3.8 %) but haematological effects were trivial. LEUPRO supplementation did not substantially alter neutrophil elastase, testosterone, or cytokine concentrations. By day 6, however, LEUPRO reduced pre-exercise cortisol 21 % (\u00b115 %) and acylcarnitine C16 (palmitoylcarnitine) during exercise, and increased post-exercise neutrophil O2 (-) (33 \u00b1 20 mmol O2 (-) cell(-1)), relative to control. Altered plasma amino acid and acylcarnitine concentrations with protein-leucine feeding might partly explain the acute post-exercise reduction in neutrophil function and increased exercise-stimulated neutrophil oxidative burst on day 6, which could impact neutrophil-dependent processes during recovery from intense training.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia is a complex process characterized by a progressive decrease in muscle mass and strength. Various nutrients have been shown to be effective in supporting muscular performance. This randomized clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a 2-month administration of food for special medical purposes composed of omega-3 fatty acids (500 mg), leucine (2.5 g), and probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei PS23 (LPPS23), on appendicular lean mass (ALM), muscle performance, inflammatory status, and amino acid profile in sarcopenic patients. A total of 60 participants (aged 79.7 \u00b1 4.8 years and a body mass index of 22.2 \u00b1 2.1 kg/m2) were enrolled and randomly assigned to either intervention (n = 22) or placebo group (n = 28). Comparing the differences in effects between groups (intervention minus placebo effects), ALM increased significantly in the intervention group (p < 0.05), with no discernible change in the placebo group. Similarly, significant differences were also observed for the Tinetti scale (+2.39 points, p < 0.05), the SPPB total score (+2.22 points, p < 0.05), and the handgrip strength (4.09 kg, p < 0.05). Visceral adipose tissue significantly decreased in the intervention group compared to the placebo group at 60 days \u22120.69 g (95% CI: \u22121.09, 0.29) vs. 0.27 g (95% CI: \u22120.11, 0.65), groups difference \u22120.96 (95% CI: \u22121.52, 0.39, p = 0.001). A statistically significant increase in levels of valine, leucine, isoleucine, and total amino acid profiles was observed in the intervention group compared with the placebo group at 60 days (p = 0.001). When taken together, these beneficial effects may be attributed to the innovative composition of this special medical-purpose food which could be considered for the treatment of sarcopenia in the elderly.",

          "content": "This study aimed to determine the effect of postexercise protein-leucine coingestion with CHO-lipid on subsequent high-intensity endurance performance and to investigate candidate mechanisms using stable isotope methods and metabolomics. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 male cyclists ingested a leucine/protein/CHO/fat supplement (LEUPRO 7.5/20/89/22 g \u00b7 h(-1), respectively) or isocaloric CHO/fat control (119/22 g \u00b7 h(-1)) 1-3 h after exercise during a 6-d training block (intense intervals, recovery, repeated-sprint performance rides). Daily protein intake was clamped at 1.9 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (LEUPRO) and 1.5 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (control). Stable isotope infusions (1-(13)C-leucine and 6,6-(2)H2-glucose), mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and nitrogen balance methods were used to determine the effects of LEUPRO on whole-body branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and glucose metabolism and protein turnover. After exercise, LEUPRO increased BCAA levels in plasma (2.6-fold; 90% confidence limits = \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and urine (2.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.2) and increased products of BCAA metabolism plasma acylcarnitine C5 (3.0-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 0.9) and urinary leucine (3.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.3) and \u03b2-aminoisobutyrate (3.4-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.4), indicating that ingesting ~10 g leucine per hour during recovery exceeds the capacity to metabolize BCAA. Furthermore, LEUPRO increased leucine oxidation (5.6-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and nonoxidative disposal (4.8-fold; \u00d7/\u00f7 1.1) and left leucine balance positive relative to control. With the exception of day 1 (LEUPRO = 17 \u00b1 20 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = -90 \u00b1 44 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)), subsequent (days 2-5) nitrogen balance was positive for both conditions (LEUPRO = 130 \u00b1 110 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1), control = 111 \u00b1 86 mg N \u00b7 kg(-1)). Compared with control feeding, LEUPRO lowered the serum creatine kinase concentration by 21%-25% (90% confidence limits = \u00b1 14%), but the effect on sprint power was trivial (day 4 = 0.4% \u00b1 1.0%, day 6 = -0.3% \u00b1 1.0%). Postexercise protein-leucine supplementation saturates BCAA metabolism and attenuates tissue damage, but effects on subsequent intense endurance performance may be inconsequential under conditions of positive daily nitrogen balance.",

          "content": "Protein intake is essential to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis, and the amino acid leucine seems to possess a superior effect on muscle protein synthesis compared to other amino acids. Native whey has higher leucine content and thus a potentially greater anabolic effect on muscle than regular whey (WPC-80). This study compared the acute anabolic effects of ingesting 2\u2009\u00d7\u200920 g of native whey protein, WPC-80 or milk protein after a resistance exercise session. 24 young resistance trained men and women took part in this double blind, randomized, partial crossover, controlled study. Participants received either WPC-80 and native whey (\u2009=\u200910), in a crossover design, or milk (\u2009=\u200912). Supplements were ingested immediately (20\u00a0g) and two hours after (20\u00a0g) a bout of heavy-load lower body resistance exercise. Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure plasma concentrations of amino acids by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry, muscle phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting, and mixed muscle protein synthesis by use of [H]phenylalanine-infusion, gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Being the main comparison, differences between native whey and WPC-80 were analysed by a one-way ANOVA and comparisons between the whey supplements and milk were analysed by a two-way ANOVA. Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 and milk (\u2009<\u20090.05). Native whey ingestion induced a greater phosphorylation of p70S6K than milk 180\u00a0min after exercise (\u2009=\u20090.03). Muscle protein synthesis rates increased 1-3\u00a0h hours after exercise with WPC-80 (0.119%), and 1-5\u00a0h after exercise with native whey (0.112%). Muscle protein synthesis rates were higher 1-5\u00a0h after exercise with native whey than with milk (0.112% vs. 0.064, \u2009=\u20090.023). Despite higher-magnitude increases in blood leucine concentrations with native whey, it was not superior to WPC-80 concerning effect on muscle protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70S6K during a 5-h post-exercise period. Native whey increased phosphorylation of p70S6K and muscle protein synthesis rates to a greater extent than milk during the 5-h post exercise period.

The objective was to examine the effect of a high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement on muscle mass preservation during intentional weight loss in obese older adults. We included 80 obese older adults in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. During a 13-wk weight loss program, all subjects followed a hypocaloric diet (-600 kcal/d) and performed resistance training 3\u00d7/wk. Subjects were randomly allocated to a high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement including a mix of other macro- and micronutrients (150 kcal, 21 g protein; 10\u00d7/wk, intervention group) or an isocaloric control. The primary outcome was change in appendicular muscle mass. The secondary outcomes were body composition, handgrip strength, and physical performance. Data were analyzed by using ANCOVA and mixed linear models with sex and baseline value as covariates. At baseline, mean \u00b1 SD age was 63 \u00b1 5.6 y, and body mass index (in kg/m(2)) was 33 \u00b1 4.4. During the trial, protein intake was 1.11 \u00b1 0.28 g \u00b7 kg body weight(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) in the intervention group compared with 0.85 \u00b1 0.24 g \u00b7 kg body weight(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) in the control group (P < 0.001). Both intervention and control groups decreased in body weight (-3.4 \u00b1 3.6 kg and -2.8 \u00b1 2.8 kg; both P < 0.001) and fat mass (-3.2 \u00b1 3.1 kg and -2.5 \u00b1 2.4 kg; both P < 0.001), with no differences between groups. The 13-wk change in appendicular muscle mass, however, was different in the intervention and control groups [+0.4 \u00b1 1.2 kg and -0.5 \u00b1 2.1 kg, respectively; \u03b2 = 0.95 kg (95% CI: 0.09, 1.81); P = 0.03]. Muscle strength and function improved over time without significant differences between groups. A high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement compared with isocaloric control preserves appendicular muscle mass in obese older adults during a hypocaloric diet and resistance exercise program and might therefore reduce the risk of sarcopenia.

Our goal was to compile data from the available studies in the literature to explore the effect of leucine supplementation on parameters associated with sarcopenia in elderly individuals.  The meta-analysis included older persons over 65 years of age who were recruited on the basis of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People sarcopenia criteria. Studies that were included were those in which at least one sarcopenia criterion was measured, including grip strength, appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height, gait speed, and the short physical performance battery index.  The meta-analysis included ten randomized controlled trials and one prospective study. The leucine group included 566 participants, whereas the placebo group included 567 patients. Patients receiving leucine and patients receiving a placebo had significantly different handgrip ( = 0.03), appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height ( = 0.0.2), and gait speed ( = 0.008). Patients received a high dosage of leucine, and there was a significant difference in the appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height ( = 0.02) and gait speed ( = 0.01) between the high dosage of the leucine group and the control group. When vitamin D was combined with leucine, the appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height ( = 0.03) significantly differed between the leucine group receiving vitamin D and the control group.  Low-quality evidence was found that older sarcopenic patients receiving leucine may show trends toward improved skeletal muscle strength, skeletal muscle quality, and physical performance. The capacity of leucine supplementation to have a beneficial therapeutic impact in older sarcopenic individuals is restricted when it is used alone without concurrent additional therapy.",

Outcomes investigated were: total body mass (TBM), FFM, fat mass (FM), total single repetition maximum (1RM), bench press (BP) 1RM, and lower body (LwB) 1RM. Databases consulted were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (Embase), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SportDiscus. Fourteen studies fit the inclusion criteria; however, 11 were analyzed after data extraction and funnel plot analysis exclusion. A total of 302 participants (18-45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 248 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes. We conclude that HMB produces a small effect on TBM gain, but this effect does not translate into significantly greater increases in FFM, strength or decreases in FM during periods of RET.

Exercise reduced leucine oxidation in the younger men (P<0.05), but not in older men. Insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated with leucine oxidation (P<0.05), and was lower in older men (P<0.05).

J Strength Cond Res 38(3): 526-532, 2024-This study examined the effects of supplementing 5 g of leucine compared with a placebo during a 10-week resistance training program on body composition parameters and adipokine concentrations in untrained, perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Thirty-five women were randomly assigned to 2 groups-leucine (LEU, n = 17) and placebo (PLC, n = 18)-in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Each group consumed the supplement or placebo every day and completed a resistance training program for 10 weeks. Using 3-day food records, a diet was assessed before the intervention and after its cessation. Body composition was assessed preintervention and postintervention using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Moreover, the concentrations of adipokines, such as adiponectin, visfatin, leptin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), were assessed preintervention and postintervention. Both groups showed an increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area ( p = 0.030) and fat-free mass (FFM; p = 0.023). There were significant group differences in concentrations of visfatin ( p = 0.020) and leptin ( p = 0.038) between the PLC and LEU groups. Visfatin displayed higher concentrations in the PLC group and leptin displayed higher concentrations in the LEU group. In addition, there were significant decreases in adiponectin concentrations for both groups (LEU: 652 \u00b1 513 to 292 \u00b1 447 pg\u00b7ml -1 ; PLC: 584 \u00b1 572 to 245 \u00b1 356 pg\u00b7ml -1 , p = 0.002) and MCP-1 only decreased in the PLC group (253 \u00b1 119 to 206 \u00b1 106 pg\u00b7ml -1 , p = 0.004). There were significant decreases in adiponectin concentrations in both groups and a decrease in MCP-1 concentrations in the PLC group. These decreases may be due to both adipokines possible relationship with VAT area. However, it is not known whether leucine has underlying properties that hinder changes in MCP-1 concentrations.",

This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse betaine supplementation's effects on exercise performance. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, focusing on studies comparing chronic betaine to a placebo in healthy humans aged 15-60\u2009years, measuring exercise outcomes. Studies with acute betaine supplementation, no control group, or animals were excluded. Quality assessment was done using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and a random-effects model was employed for the meta-analysis. The review included 17 studies with 317 participants (21% female). The results revealed a significant effect size of 0.47 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.89) for maximal strength (1RM, 3RM, maximal isokinetic or isometric force), particularly in the lower body (SMD: 0.49, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.98). No significant effects were found for upper body strength, cycling sprint power, bench press throws power, or muscular endurance. However, vertical jumping performance improved significantly (SMD: 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.69) after excluding a low-quality study. In conclusion, betaine supplementation for at least 7\u2009days significantly enhances muscular strength, especially lower body strength, and shows potential in improving vertical jumping performance.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of betaine supplementation on development-related hormones, body composition, and anthropometrics in professional youth soccer players during a competitive season. Twenty-nine players (age, 15.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u2009years) were matched based upon position and then randomly assigned to a betaine group (2\u2009g/day; n\u2009=\u200914, BG) or placebo group (PG, n\u2009=\u200915). All subjects participated in team practices, conditioning, and games. If a subject did not participate in a game, a conditioning protocol was used to ensure workload was standardized throughout the 14-week season. Growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), testosterone, cortisol, height, weight, and body composition were assessed at pre-season (P1), mid-season (P2) and post-season (P3). Anthropometric variables were also measured following a one-year follow-up (F). Significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) group x time interactions were found for testosterone and testosterone to cortisol ratio (T/C). Both variables were greater in BG at P2 and P3 compared to P1, however, the testosterone was less in the PG at P3 compared to P2. There was no significant group by time interactions for GH, IGF-1, lean body mass, or body fat. There was a significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) group x time interaction in height and weight at F, with the greater increases in BG compared to PG. Betaine supplementation increased testosterone levels and T/C ratio in youth professional soccer players during a competitive season. Betaine supplementation had no negative effects on growth (height and weight) and may attenuate reductions in testosterone due to intense training during puberty.",

Betaine may enhance performance during a competitive season by increasing the testosterone to cortisol ratio and reducing systemic inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of betaine supplementation on the bio-motor abilities in young professional soccer players. Twenty-nine young professional soccer players (age, 15.5\u00b10.3 years) were matched by position and randomly assigned to one of two groups for 14 weeks: betaine (BG, 2\u00a0g/day; n=14) or placebo (PG n=15). Diet was standardized by a nutritionist, and measures of muscular power (countermovement jump: CMJ), change of direction: modified 5-0-5), acceleration (10\u00a0m sprint), sprint performance (30\u00a0m sprint time: SpT), muscular strength (leg press and bench press one repetition maximum: 1-RM), repeated sprint ability (running-based anaerobic sprint test: RAST), and aerobic capacity (30-15 intermittent fitness test) were assessed in the pre (P1), mid (P2) and post (P3) season over the course of 5 days. All subjects participated in one soccer match and five training sessions per week. Significant (p < 0.05) group x time interactions were found for maximal oxygen uptake (VO), anaerobic peak power, and muscular strength favoring BG at P2 and P3 compared to P1. There were meaningful (p < 0.05) group x time interactions for CMJ, SpT, and peak power during the RAST that favored the BG. 14-week of betaine supplementation increased predicted 1-RM, VO, and repeated sprint ability performance in youth professional soccer players.

          "content": "This study examined the effects of 2 weeks of betaine versus placebo supplementation (3 g/d) on 60 km cycling performance, gut permeability, and shifts in plasma metabolites. Participants included 21 male and female non-elite cyclists. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design was used with two 2-week supplementation periods and a 2-week washout period. Supplementation periods were followed by a 60 km cycling time trial. Six blood samples were collected before and after supplementation (overnight fasted state), and at 0 h, 1.5 h, 3 h, and 24 h post-exercise. Five-hour urine samples were collected pre-supplementation and post-60 km cycling after ingesting a sugar solution containing lactulose 5 g, C mannitol 100 mg, and C mannitol 1.9 g in 450 mL water. Other outcome measures included plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein-1 (I-FABP), muscle damage biomarkers (serum creatine kinase, myoglobin), serum cortisol, complete blood cell counts, and shifts in plasma metabolites using untargeted metabolomics. The time to complete the 60 km cycling bout differed significantly between the betaine and placebo trials (mean \u00b1 SE, 112.8 \u00b1 2.3, 114.2 \u00b1 2.6 min, respectively, (-1.41 \u00b1 0.7 min) (effect size = 0.475,  = 0.042).

Untargeted metabolomics showed that 214 metabolites exhibited significant trial treatment effects and 130 significant trial x time interaction effects. Betaine versus placebo supplementation was linked to significant increases in plasma betaine, dimethylglycine (DMG), sarcosine, methionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), alpha-ketoglutaramate, and 5'methylthioadensone (MTA), and decreases in plasma carnitine and numerous acylcarnitines. Betaine supplementation modestly improved 60 km cycling performance but had no effect on gut permeability. The metabolomics data supported a strong influence of 2-week intake of betaine on the one-carbon metabolism pathway during the 24 h recovery period.",

The effects of chronic betaine supplementation on exercise performance, skeletal muscle oxygen saturation, and associated biochemical parameters in resistance trained men. J Strength Cond Res 25(12): 3461-3471, 2011-We examined the effects of chronic betaine supplementation on exercise performance and associated parameters in resistance trained men. Men were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner using a crossover design to consume betaine (2.5 g of betaine mixed in 500 ml of Gatorade\u00ae) or a placebo (500 ml of Gatorade\u00ae) for 14 days, with a 21-day washout period. Before and after each treatment period, tests of lower- and upper-body muscular power and isometric force were conducted, including a test of upper-body muscular endurance (10 sets of bench press exercise to failure). Muscle tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) during the bench press protocol was measured via near infrared spectroscopy. Blood samples were collected before and after the exercise test protocol for analysis of lactate, nitrate/nitrite (NOx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). When analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance, no significant differences were noted between conditions for exercise performance variables (p > 0.05). However, an increase in total repetitions (p = 0.01) and total volume load (p = 0.02) in the 10-set bench press protocol was noted with betaine supplementation (paired t-tests), with values increasing approximately 6.5% from preintervention to postintervention. Although not of statistical significance (p = 0.14), postexercise blood lactate increased to a lesser extent with betaine supplementation (210%) compared with placebo administration (270%). NOx was lower postintervention as compared with preintervention (p = 0.06), and MDA was relatively unchanged. The decrease in StO2 during the bench press protocol was greater with betaine vs. placebo (p = 0.01), possibly suggesting enhanced muscle oxygen consumption. These findings indicate that betaine supplementation results in a moderate increase in total repetitions and volume load in the bench press exercise, without favorably impacting other performance measures.",

However, no longitudinal study has been conducted to illustrate if choline and betaine have long-term effects on changes in body composition. This study aimed to prospectively investigate the association between serum choline and betaine concentrations and 3-year changes in body composition in community-dwelling Chinese adults. This present analysis used data from 1384 women and 554 men aged 40-75 years. Serum concentrations of betaine and choline at baseline were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Body composition parameters, i.e., muscle mass (MM), fat mass (FM), and body fat percentage (FM%) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the first and the second follow-ups. After adjustment for potential cofounders, higher serum choline concentrations were associated with a lower decrease in MM in men (\u03b2 = 0.022,  = 0.025) and a lower increase in FM and FM% in women with baseline choline concentrations below 21.5 \u03bcmol/L (all  for nonlinearity = 0.007); higher serum betaine concentrations were associated with a lower decline in MM and a lower increase in FM and FM% among men whose betaine concentrations were lower than 55 \u03bcmol/L (all  for nonlinearity < 0.05). These findings suggest that higher concentrations of serum choline and betaine may be associated with favorable changes in body composition profiles among men and women who have relatively low concentrations, especially in men.  Higher concentrations of serum choline and betaine were associated with favorable changes in body composition. Such favorable associations were more pronounced in men.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between resistance training adaptation and chronic betaine supplementation in females. Twenty-three young women (21.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u00a0years, 165.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u00a0cm, 68.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8\u00a0kg) without prior structured resistance training experience volunteered for this study. Body composition (BodPod), rectus femoris muscle thickness (B-mode Ultrasound), vertical jump, back squat 1RM and bench press 1RM were assessed pre- and post-training. Following 1\u00a0week of familiarization training, subjects were matched for body composition and squat strength, and randomly assigned to either a betaine (2.5\u00a0g/day; n\u2009=\u200911) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200912) group that completed 3 sets of 6-7 exercises per day performed to momentary muscular failure. Training was divided into two lower and one upper body training sessions per week performed on non-consecutive days for 8\u00a0weeks, and weekly volume load was used to analyze work capacity. Significant main effects of time were found for changes in lean mass (2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u00a0kg), muscle thickness (0.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u00a0cm), vertical jump (1.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u00a0cm), squat 1RM (39.8\u2009\u00b1\u200914.0\u00a0kg), and bench press 1 RM (9.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\u00a0kg); however, there were no significant interactions. A trend (p\u2009=\u2009.056) was found for greater weekly training volumes for betaine versus placebo. Significant interactions were found for changes in body fat percentage and fat mass: body fat percentage and fat mass decreased significantly more in betaine (-\u20093.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7%; -\u20092.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u00a0kg) compared to placebo (-\u20091.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6%; -\u20090.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u00a0kg), respectively.

We examined the association of serum concentrations of choline and betaine with body composition and fat distribution in adults. This community-based study recruited 1996 adults (women/men: 1380/616) aged 40-75 years in urban Guangzhou, China. General information and anthropometric measurements were taken, and serum choline and betaine levels were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry between July 2008 and June 2010. After 3.2 years, 1623 of the 1996 participants were measured for fat mass (FM and %FM) over the total body (TB), trunk, limbs, android (A) and gynoid (G) regions. The %FM ratios of the A/G regions and the trunk and limbs were determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Univariate analyses showed that higher serum betaine levels were significantly associated with lower values of adiposity indices (all P-trends<0.05), except in the case of the %FM at the gynoid area. After adjusting for potential covariates, similar associations were observed. The mean percentage differences between quartiles 4 and 1 of the serum betaine levels were -4.9% (weight), -4.7% (body mass index, BMI), -2.5% (waist circumference), -7.9% (TB FM) and -3.4% (TB %FM). The mean differences in the FM and %FM were much more pronounced at the trunk (-10.0 and -4.5%) or android areas (-10.7 and -4.7%) than those at the limbs (-0.8 and -2.3%) or gynoid areas (-0.6 and -1.4%). Such favorable associations were stronger in men than in women. No significant associations between serum choline and the adiposity indices were observed, except in the cases of body weight and BMI. Greater circulating betaine, but not choline, was dose-dependently associated with better body composition and fat distribution due to a lower FM in the trunk regions in this population.",

          "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to a variety of causes. Most patients remain undiagnosed at early stage of CKD and proceed to end stage CKD due to unawareness and lacking of efficient biomarkers. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and its predecessor products: choline, L-carnitine and betaine are associated with reduced renal function. However, whether the combined variation of the four metabolites could contribute in prediction and stratification of impaired glomerular function in Chinese CKD patients is unknown. Our aim is to investigate the associations of plasma TMAO, choline, L-carnitine and betaine with glomerular filtration in CKD patients. A total of 65 CKD patients and 64 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Fasting plasma metabolites were detected using liquid chromatography-based method. Plasma TMAO, choline, betaine and L-carnitine levels were differentially correlated with eGFR. The four metabolites were independently associated with CKD after adjustment for multiple traditional risk factors. The combination of the four metabolites had good performance at discriminating CKD from healthy controls (AUC\u2009=\u20090.96) as well as discriminating low eGFR from high eGFR in CKD (AUC\u2009=\u20090.96). Combinations of TMAO and its precursors were associated with glomerular function and might be utilized in evaluation of CKD.",

          "content": "Choline and betaine have been suggested to play a pivotal role in neurotransmitter synthesis, cell membrane integrity, and methyl-group metabolism, exerting neuroprotective effects in patients with various neurological disorders. However, population-based evidence on choline and betaine with subsequent cardiovascular events after stroke is rare. We aimed to prospectively investigate the relationships of circulating choline and betaine with cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic stroke. We performed a nested case-control study within the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke. A total of 323 cardiovascular events (including 264 recurrent strokes) and 323 controls (free of recurrent cardiovascular events) matched for age (\u00b11 y), sex, and treatment group were included. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events after ischemic stroke. Plasma choline and betaine were measured at baseline by ultra-high-performance LC-MS/MS. Conditional logistic regression models were applied, and discrimination, reclassification, and calibration of models with choline pathway metabolites were evaluated. Plasma choline and betaine were inversely associated with cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke after ischemic stroke. Specifically, in fully adjusted models, each additional SD of choline and betaine was associated with 35% (95% CI: 20%-48%) and 30% (95% CI: 14%-43%) decreased risks of subsequent cardiovascular events, respectively, and 34% (95% CI: 16%-48%) and 29% (95% CI: 12%-43%) decreased risks of recurrent stroke, respectively. In addition, both choline and betaine offered substantial risk discrimination and reclassification improvement for cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke beyond traditional risk factors, as evidenced by an increase in C statistics, the net reclassification index, and integrated discrimination improvement. Plasma choline pathway metabolites, including choline and betaine, were associated with decreased risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke and provided incremental value in risk discrimination and stratification in patients with ischemic stroke. This nested case-control study was based on the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke, which is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01840072.",

          "content": "Betaine is distributed widely in animals, plants, and microorganisms, and rich dietary sources include seafood, especially marine invertebrates ( approximately 1%); wheat germ or bran ( approximately 1%); and spinach ( approximately 0.7%). The principal physiologic role of betaine is as an osmolyte and methyl donor (transmethylation). As an osmolyte, betaine protects cells, proteins, and enzymes from environmental stress (eg, low water, high salinity, or extreme temperature). As a methyl donor, betaine participates in the methionine cycle-primarily in the human liver and kidneys. Inadequate dietary intake of methyl groups leads to hypomethylation in many important pathways, including 1) disturbed hepatic protein (methionine) metabolism as determined by elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations and decreased S-adenosylmethionine concentrations, and 2) inadequate hepatic fat metabolism, which leads to steatosis (fatty accumulation) and subsequent plasma dyslipidemia. This alteration in liver metabolism may contribute to various diseases, including coronary, cerebral, hepatic, and vascular diseases. Betaine has been shown to protect internal organs, improve vascular risk factors, and enhance performance. Databases of betaine content in food are being developed for correlation with population health studies. The growing body of evidence shows that betaine is an important nutrient for the prevention of chronic disease.",

Nineteen males participated in a repeated-measures within-subjects study to assess objective and subjective measures of sleep, completed counter-movement jumps (CMJ) and repeated sprint morning performance (RSP). Three days of baseline food intake showed no major deficiencies of zinc, magnesium or vitamin B6 for all participants (11.9 \u00b1 3.4, 395 \u00b1 103 and 2.7 \u00b1 0.9 mg.day, respectively). Sleep (22:30-06:30 h) was assessed via actimetry, and either a control (no tablets, NoPill), dextrose placebo (PLAC) or ZMA was ingested 30-60 min before retiring to bed for two nights. The participants undertook the three conditions (NoPill, PLAC or ZMA) administered in a counterbalanced order. The data were analyzed using general linear models with repeated measures. In healthy active males who consume diets of adequate micronutrients, sleep normally and maintain good sleep hygiene (time to bed and wake times), ZMA supplementation had no beneficial effect on RSP or performance in the Stroop test ( > 0.05) but did improve CMJ height ( < 0.001) compared to that of PLAC but not NoPill ( > 0.05). Supplementation of ZMA for two nights had no effect on sleep, RSP or cognitive function. The NoPill condition elucidated the effects of the intervention under investigation.",

Twenty-two Australian elite male rugby league players (mean +/- SD; age = 19.8 +/- 2.9 years; weight = 88.0 +/- 9.5 kg) were match-paired and randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to either a T. terrestris (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11) group. All subjects performed structured heavy resistance training as part of the club's preseason preparations. A T. terrestris extract (450 mg.d(-1)) or placebo capsules were consumed once daily for 5 weeks. Muscular strength, body composition, and the urinary T/E ratio were monitored prior to and after supplementation. After 5 weeks of training, strength and fat free mass increased significantly without any between-group differences. No between-group differences were noted in the urinary T/E ratio. It was concluded that T. terrestris did not produce the large gains in strength or lean muscle mass that many manufacturers claim can be experienced within 5-28 days. Furthermore, T. terrestris did not alter the urinary T/E ratio and would not place an athlete at risk of testing positive based on the World Anti-Doping Agency's urinary T/E ratio limit of 4:1.",

The aim of this study was to examine whether  L. supplementation can attenuate oxidative stress and inflammatory responses to acute aerobic exercise and improve DOMS. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design study, thirteen healthy men received either a daily supplement of  L. or a placebo for 4\u2009weeks (2-week wash-out period between trials). Before and after the supplementation periods, participants performed an exercise test to exhaustion (75% VOmax). DOMS, thigh girth, and knee joint range of motion (KJRM) were assessed before and after the exercise (2, 24, and 48\u2009h). Blood samples were analyzed for reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, GSH/GSSG ratio, protein carbonyls, total antioxidant capacity, creatine kinase activity, white blood cell count, and TBARS. Acute exercise to exhaustion induced inflammatory responses and changed the blood redox status in both Tribulus and Placebo groups (\u2009<\u20090.050).  L. improved GSH fall (\u2009=\u20090.005), GSSG rise (\u2009=\u20090.001) and maintained a higher level of GSH/GSSG ratio at the 2\u2009h point (\u2009=\u20090.034). TBARS were lowered, protein carbonyls, creatine kinase activity, and white blood cell count elevation diminished significantly (\u2009<\u20090.050).  L. administration did not affect DOMS, thigh girth, or KJRM (\u2009>\u20090.050). 4-weeks of  L. supplementation effectively attenuates oxidative stress responses but cannot improve DOMS.",

(TT) ingredients have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, but their effects on exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) in trained athletes are uncertain. The purpose of this single-blind placebo-controlled trial, in accordance with CONSORT guidelines, was to examine the effect of 6 weeks of TT supplementation on muscle metabolism, inflammation biomarkers, and oxidant status. Thirty trained male CrossFit\u00ae athletes were randomly assigned to be supplemented with 770 mg/day of TT (intervention group (IG)) or receive a placebo daily (control group (CG)) for 6 weeks. Muscle damage enzymes, inflammation biomarkers, and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) were assessed at baseline (T1), 21 days after baseline (T2), and after 42 days (T3). Grace, a Workout of the Day, was measured in T1 and T3. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was found between IG and CG in Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and TAS levels at the end of the follow-up. Furthermore, TAS levels were significantly (p < 0.05) lower at T2 and T3 relative to baseline in the IG, also LDH and CRP increased significantly (p < 0.05) at T2 and T3 relative to baseline in the CG. No significant (p > 0.05) decreases in muscle damage or inflammation biomarkers were observed, although a slight downward trend was observed after 6 weeks for supplemented athletes. TT supplementation could attenuate the CrossFit\u00ae training program-induced oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inflammation which could be due to the natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of TT.",

          "content": "The use of nutraceutical products to enhance male sexual performance has a long history, especially with regard to the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Alternative treatments for ED are becoming increasingly popular, with growing interest from consumers, as well as increased revenue for manufacturers. Dietary supplements (DSs), which are a mixture of active ingredients, are mainly sold online. In randomized controlled trials, the molecules contained in DSs have demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness, or even have no evidence to support their use. However, none of the studies carried out provided sufficient evidence to consider these products a first-line therapy. Therefore, the combination of the various active ingredients, especially in relation to the daily dose, leaves doubts about the real effectiveness. In order to evaluate the potential efficacy of DS formulations, we analyzed the products marketed in Italy using a scoring approach. A systematic review of the literature was performed to evaluate the effect of DS and to detect the active ingredients able to improve erectile function-called effective ingredients (EIs)-and their minimal effective daily dose (mED). A metanalysis identified some nutraceuticals, such as Panax ginseng, Tribulus terrestris and L-arginine, that are able to improve male sexual function. Based on the scoring system, 2 (8%) supplements matched with the cluster of higher expected efficacy, 3 (12%) with the lower efficacy cluster and 20 (80%) matched with the criterion of no expected efficacy. DSs marketed in Italy are usually blends of many substances that are frequently employed at a negligible dose or without any evidence.",

Subjects performed 3 days of resistance training per week for 8 weeks. Each day during Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, subjects consumed either placebo (PL; n = 10) or a supplement (ANDRO-6; n = 10), which contained daily doses of 300 mg androstenedione, 150 mg DHEA, 750 mg Tribulus terrestris, 625 mg Chrysin, 300 mg Indole-3-carbinol, and 540 mg Saw palmetto. Serum androstenedione concentrations were higher in ANDRO-6 after 2, 5, and 8 weeks (p <.05), while serum concentrations of free and total testosterone were unchanged in both groups. Serum estradiol was elevated at Weeks 2, 5, and 8 in ANDRO-6 (p <.05), and serum estrone was elevated at Weeks 5 and 8 (p <.05). Muscle strength increased (p <.05) similarly from Weeks 0 to 4, and again from Weeks 4 to 8 in both treatment groups. The acute effect of one third of the daily dose of ANDRO-6 and PL was studied in 10 men (23 +/- 4 years). Serum androstenedione concentrations were elevated (p <.05) in ANDRO-6 from 150 to 360 min after ingestion, while serum free or total testosterone concentrations were unchanged. These data provide evidence that the addition of these herbal extracts to androstenedione does not result in increased serum testosterone concentrations, reduce the estrogenic effect of androstenedione, and does not augment the adaptations to resistance training.",

Tribulus terrestris is an herb often used by athletes as a nutritional supplement for performance enhancement. Although it is thought to be relatively safe, serious side effects have been reported before. Our aim is to increase awareness of the potential toxicities of performance enhancing herbal medications. These are often sold over-the-counter and therefore casually used, especially by young healthy individuals. Beneficial effects are controversial. Under-reporting by patients and infrequent documentation by health-care providers can delay diagnosis.

We hypothesized that DAA supplementation would contribute to an increase in the luteinizing hormone (LH), free, and testosterone and a greater increase in hematological variables. Sixteen male boxers participated; they were randomly assigned to an experimental group (DAA) or a control group (C) and underwent 14 days of supplementation, 6 g/day of DAA. Both DAA and C participants were exposed to normobaric hypoxia (FiO = 15.5%; 2500 m) for 10-12 h a day over a period of 11 days. The results showed that DAA had no significant effect on resting, LH, or the testosterone/cortisol ratio during the training camp. Hypoxic exposure significantly ( < 0.05) increased red blood cell and reticulocyte counts as well as hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in both groups, but DAA had no significant effect on these changes. In conclusion, we found that DAA supplementation at a dose of 6 g/day for 14 days does not affect the testosterone, cortisol, or hematological responses of athletes during.",

          "content": "The prediction of the chronological age of a deceased individual at time of death can provide important information in case of unidentified bodies. The methodological possibilities in these cases depend on the availability of tissues, whereby bones are preserved for a long time due to their mineralization under normal environmental conditions. Age-dependent changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) as well as the accumulation of pentosidine (Pen) and D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) could be useful molecular markers for age prediction. A combination of such molecular clocks into one age prediction model seems favorable to minimize inter- and intra-individual variation. We therefore developed (I) age prediction models based on the three molecular clocks, (II) examined the improvement of age prediction by combination, and (III) investigated if samples with signs of decomposition can also be examined using these three molecular clocks. Skull bone from deceased individuals was collected to obtain a training dataset (n\u2009=\u200986), and two independent test sets (without signs of decomposition: n\u2009=\u200944, with signs of decomposition: n\u2009=\u200948). DNAm of 6 CpG sites in ELOVL2, KLF14, PDE4C, RPA2, TRIM59 and ZYG11A was analyzed using massive parallel sequencing (MPS). The D-Asp and Pen contents were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Age prediction models based on ridge regression were developed resulting in mean absolute errors (MAEs)/root mean square errors (RMSE) of 5.5years /6.6 years (DNAm), 7.7 years /9.3 years (Pen) and 11.7 years /14.6 years (D-Asp) in the test set. Unsurprisingly, a general lower accuracy for the DNAm, D-Asp, and Pen models was observed in samples from decomposed bodies (MAE: 7.4-11.8 years, RMSE: 10.4-15.4 years). This reduced accuracy could be caused by multiple factors with different impact on each molecular clock. To acknowledge general changes due to decomposition, a pilot model for a possible age prediction based on the decomposed samples as training set improved the accuracy evaluated by leave-one-out-cross validation (MAE: 6.6-12 years, RMSE: 8.1-15.9 years). The combination of all three molecular age clocks did reveal comparable MAE and RMSE results to the pure analysis of the DNA methylation for the test set without signs of decomposition. However, an improvement by the combination of all three clocks was possible for the decomposed samples, reducing especially the deviation in case of outliers in samples with very high decomposition and low DNA content. The results demonstrate the general potential in a combined analysis of different molecular clocks in specific cases.",

A 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted. Fibromyalgia patients were randomly assigned to receive either creatine monohydrate or placebo in a double-blind manner. The patients were evaluated at baseline and after 16 weeks. Muscle function, aerobic conditioning, cognitive function, quality of sleep, quality of life, kidney function, and adverse events were assessed. Muscle phosphorylcreatine content was measured through (31) P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After the intervention, the creatine group presented higher muscle phosphorylcreatine content when compared with the placebo group (+80.3% versus -2.7%; P = 0.04). Furthermore, the creatine group presented greater muscle strength than the placebo group in the leg press and chest press exercises (+9.8% and +1.2% for creatine versus -0.5% and -7.2% for placebo, respectively; P = 0.02 and P = 0.002, respectively). Isometric strength was greater in the creatine group than in the placebo group (+6.4% versus -3.2%; P = 0.007). However, no general changes were observed in aerobic conditioning, pain, cognitive function, quality of sleep, and quality of life. Food intake remained unaltered and no side effects were reported. Creatine supplementation increased intramuscular phosphorylcreatine content and improved lower- and upper-body muscle function, with minor changes in other fibromyalgia features. These findings introduce creatine supplementation as a useful dietary intervention to improve muscle function in fibromyalgia patients.",

It improves muscle performance in healthy individuals and might be helpful for treating myopathies. To evaluate the efficacy of oral creatine supplementation in muscle diseases. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register in May 2004 for randomised trials using the search term 'creatine'. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2005) using the same search term. We adapted this strategy to search MEDLINE (PubMed, from January 1966 to September 2005) and EMBASE (from January 1980 to May 2004). We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials identified, contacted the authors and known experts in the field and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data. Types of studies: randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials. people of all ages with hereditary muscle disease. Types of intervention: any creatine supplementation of at least 0.03 g/kg body weight/day. change in muscle strength measured by quantitative muscle testing. change in muscle strength measured by manual muscle testing, change in energy parameters assessed by 31 phosphorous spectroscopy, change in muscle mass or a surrogate for muscle mass, adverse events. Two authors independently applied the selection criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Some missing data were obtained from investigators. Twelve trials, including 266 participants, met the selection criteria. One trial compared creatine and glutamine treatment with placebo. In trials with 138 participants with muscular dystrophies treated with creatine, there was a significant increase in maximum voluntary contraction in the creatine group compared to placebo, with a weighted mean difference of 8.47% (95% confidence intervals 3.55 to 13.38). There was also an increase in lean body mass during creatine treatment compared to placebo (weighted mean difference 0.63 kg, 95% confidence intervals 0.02 to 1.25). No trial reported any clinically relevant adverse event. In trials with 33 participants with metabolic myopathies treated with creatine, there was no significant difference in maximum voluntary contraction between the creatine and placebo group (weighted mean difference -2.26%, confidence intervals -6.29 to 1.78). One trial reported a significant increase in muscle pain during high-dose creatine treatment (150 mg/kg body weight) in glycogen storage disease type V. Evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that short- and medium-term creatine treatment improves muscle strength in people with muscular dystrophies, and is well-tolerated. Evidence from randomised controlled trials does not show significant improvement in muscle strength in metabolic myopathies. High-dose creatine in glycogenosis type V increased muscle pain.",

However, concerns have been raised about the potential role in promoting hair loss by increasing dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Currently, there is no direct evidence examining the relationship between creatine supplementation and hair follicle health. Therefore, the purpose was to determine the effects of 12\u2009weeks of creatine supplementation on androgen levels and hair follicle health in healthy young males. Forty-five resistance-trained males (ages 18-40 years) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a creatine monohydrate (5\u2009g/day) or placebo (5\u2009g maltodextrin/day) group. Participants maintained their habitual diets and training routines. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 12\u2009weeks to measure total testosterone, free testosterone, and DHT. Hair follicle health was assessed using the Trichogram test and the FotoFinder system (hair density, follicular unit count, and cumulative hair thickness). Statistical analyses were performed using repeated measures ANOVA, and potential outliers were examined through sensitivity analysis.

          "content": "Creatine is a supplement used by sportsmen to increase athletic performance by improving energy supply to muscle tissues. It is also an essential brain compound and some hypothesize that it aids cognition by improving energy supply and neuroprotection. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of oral creatine administration on cognitive function in healthy individuals. A search of multiple electronic databases was performed for the identification of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the cognitive effects of oral creatine supplementation in healthy individuals. Six studies (281 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Generally, there was evidence that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration. Regarding other cognitive domains, such as long-term memory, spatial memory, memory scanning, attention, executive function, response inhibition, word fluency, reaction time and mental fatigue, the results were conflicting. Performance on cognitive tasks stayed unchanged in young individuals. Vegetarians responded better than meat-eaters in memory tasks but for other cognitive domains no differences were observed. Oral creatine administration may improve short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning of healthy individuals but its effect on other cognitive domains remains unclear. Findings suggest potential benefit for aging and stressed individuals. Since creatine is safe, future studies should include larger sample sizes. It is imperative that creatine should be tested on patients with dementias or cognitive impairment.",

          "content": "Creatine supplementation could be a nonexpensive, safe, and effective dietary intervention to counteract bone loss. The aim of this study was to investigate whether long-term creatine supplementation can improve bone health in older, postmenopausal women. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial was conducted between November 2011 and December 2017 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Two hundred postmenopausal women with osteopenia were randomly allocated to receive either creatine monohydrate (3 g/d) or placebo for 2 years. At baseline and after 12 and 24 months, we assessed areal bone mineral density (aBMD; primary outcome), lean and fat mass (through dual X-ray absorptiometry), volumetric BMD and bone microarchitecture parameters, biochemical bone markers, physical function and strength, and the number of falls and fractures. Possible adverse effects were self-reported. Lumbar spine (p < .001), femoral neck (p < .001), and total femur aBMD (p = .032) decreased across time; however, no interaction effect was observed (all p > .050). Bone markers, microarchitecture parameters, and the number of falls/fractures were not changed with creatine (all p > .050). Lean mass and appendicular skeletal muscle mass increased throughout the intervention (p < .001), with no additive effect of creatine (p = .731 and p = .397, respectively). Creatine did not affect health-related laboratory parameters. Creatine supplementation more than 2 years did not improve bone health in older, postmenopausal women with osteopenia, nor did it affect lean mass or muscle function in this population. This refutes the long-lasting notion that this dietary supplement alone has osteogenic or anabolic properties in the long run. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT: 01472393.",

          "content": "The role of creatine supplementation in young athletes and bodybuilders is well established including ergogenic properties of muscular hypertrophy, strength, power, and endurance. Whether the benefits of creatine supplementation translate to an aging population with moderate training stimulus remains unclear especially in regard to gender, creatine dose, and duration. This systematic review assessed whether creatine supplementation combined with exercise results in additive improvements in indices of skeletal muscle, bone, and mental health over exercise alone in healthy older adults. PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were utilized to identify randomized controlled trials of creatine supplementation combined with exercise in an aging population with additional predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, and performed quality assessments using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Seventeen studies were comprehensively reviewed according to categories of strength, endurance, functional capacity, body composition, cognition, and safety. These studies suggest that any additive ergogenic creatine effects on upper and/or lower body strength, functional capacity, and lean mass in an older population would require a continuous and daily low-dose creatine supplementation combined with at least 12 weeks of resistance training. Potential creatine specific increases in regional bone mineral density of the femur are possible but may require at least 1 year of creatine supplementation combined with moderate resistance training, and additional long-term clinical trials are warranted. The limited data suggested no additive effects of creatine over exercise alone on indices of mental health. The beneficial effects of creatine supplementation are more consistent in older women than in men. Creatine monohydrate is safe to use in older adults. While creatine in conjunction with moderate- to high-intensity exercise in an aging population may improve skeletal muscle health, additional studies are needed to determine the effective dosing and duration paradigm for potential combined creatine and exercise effects on bone and cognition in older adults.",

Efficacy of alternative forms of creatine supplementation on improving performance and body composition in healthy subjects: a systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 36(9): 2663-2670, 2022-Novel forms of creatine have appeared in the marketplace with substantial claims of improved efficacy compared to creatine monohydrate (CrM). The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review on alternative forms of creatine to determine (a) whether they are effective ergogenic aids and (b) whether they outperform CrM. A separate comparison was conducted to determine average cost of various forms of creatine. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar were systematically reviewed according to PRISMA guidelines. The design of the review was set to answer the PICOS model (subjects, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design). Seventeen randomized placebo controlled clinical trials examining exercise performance outcomes and body composition were included in the analysis. Magnesium-creatine chelate and creatine citrate, malate, ethyl ester, nitrate, and pyruvate were the only forms researched in the literature. Of these studies, only 3 studies compared the alternative creatine form to CrM, making it difficult to compare efficacy to CrM. There were no consistent findings of performance enhancement among alternative forms of creatine when compared to placebo. A review of the marketplace shows that CrM is the lowest cost form of creatine. Due to the paucity of studies on alternative forms of creatine as well as high prices on the market of these alternative forms, CrM remains as the most extensively studied form of creatine that shows efficacy, safety, and lowest cost to consumer.",

TRAD training increased maximum strength (1 repetition maximum (1RM)) compared with BFR after 8 weeks of training (\u00a0=\u00a00.021). Repetitions to failure at 30% of 1RM were increased in the BFR-CR group compared with the TRAD-CR group (\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Repetitions to failure at 70% 1RM were increased from weeks 0-4 (\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 4-8 (\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in all groups. Creatine supplementation exerted a hypertrophic effect when utilized with TRAD and BFR paradigms and increased muscle performance at 30% 1RM when utilized in conjunction with BFR. Therefore, creatine supplementation seems to amplify muscle adaptation following a BFR program.

The present double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluated the effect of creatine monohydrate supplementation on a panel of blood and urine health indicators in resistance training practitioners. Eighteen males performing resistance training three times per week were supplemented with 0.3 g/kg per day creatine monohydrate for 7 days and compared with matched controls supplemented with dextrosol. Blood and urine samples were collected pre- and 30 days post-supplementation to evaluate 41 biochemical parameters and renal function. Creatine monohydrate supplementation did not cause adverse events and, as expected, promoted an increase of the performance and body weight. No modification of red blood cells parameters, white blood cells profile, blood lipid profile, metabolic and urine markers, hepatic and renal function were observed in the supplemented group. Despite the expected weight increase, the creatine monohydrate supplementation is safe for health and no detrimental effects on different organs and physiological systems were observed in our cohort of volunteers.",

Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of creatine on muscle function and metabolism, aerobic capacity, fatigue, physical activity, and quality of life (QOL), as well as its safety. We conducted a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, multiple-baseline design; patients were assigned to creatine or placebo. Feasibility was assessed using attended study visits, completed study procedures, and adherence. Muscle function, aerobic capacity, and muscle strength were assessed with standardized exercise tests. Muscle metabolism was assessed using a 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy protocol. Fatigue, physical activity, and QOL were assessed by questionnaires. Statistical significance was estimated using a randomization (permutation) test. Changes in outcome measures taken at baseline and end-of-study were calculated using paired -tests. Median (range) adherence to the study drug was 88.5% (20.5-95.5%) and the proportion of subjects with 80% adherence or higher was 76.9%. There were no missed study visits. There were no statistically significant changes in muscle function, strength, aerobic capacity, disease activity, fatigue, physical activity, or QOL while subjects were receiving creatine compared to placebo. There were statistically significant adaptations in muscle metabolism (e.g., decrease in change in muscle pH following exercise, and decrease in phosphate/phosphocreatine ratio) at the end-of-study compared to baseline. There were no significant adverse effects. Creatine supplementation in children with JDM is feasible to study, and is safe and well-tolerated; it may lead to improvements in muscle metabolism.",

          "content": "Muscle mass is important for metastatic prostate cancer survival and quality of life (QoL). The backbone of treatment for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with an androgen signaling inhibitor. ADT is an effective cancer treatment, but it facilitates significant declines in muscle mass and adverse health outcomes important to mCSPC survivors, such as fatigue, and reductions in physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, and QoL. In non-metastatic CSPC survivors, resistance training (RT) preserves muscle mass and improves these related health outcomes, but the biggest barrier to RT in CSPC survivors of all stages is fatigue. Creatine monohydrate supplementation coupled with RT (Cr\u2009+\u2009RT) may address this barrier since creatine plays a critical role in energy metabolism. Cr\u2009+\u2009RT in cancer-free older adults and other clinical populations improves muscle mass and related health outcomes. Evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation can complement cancer treatment. Thus, Cr\u2009+\u2009RT is a strategy that addresses gaps in survivorship needs of people with mCSPC. The purpose of this parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial is to test the effects of 52-weeks of Cr\u2009+\u2009RT compared with placebo (PLA) and RT (PLA\u2009+\u2009RT) on muscle mass, other related health outcomes, and markers of cancer progression. We will carry out this trial with our team's established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program in 200 mCSPC survivors receiving ADT, and evaluate outcomes at baseline, 24-, and 52-weeks. RT will occur twice weekly with elastic resistance bands, and an established creatine supplementation protocol will be used for supplementation delivery. Our approach addresses a major facilitator to RT in mCSPC survivors, a home-based RT program, while utilizing a supervised model for safety. Findings will improve delivery of comprehensive survivorship care by providing a multicomponent, patient-centered lifestyle strategy to preserve muscle mass, improve health outcomes, and complement cancer treatment (NCT06112990).",

          "content": "Although oral creatine supplementation is very popular among athletes, no prospective placebo-controlled studies on the adverse effects of long-term supplementation have yet been conducted. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of creatine monohydrate in patients with the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, because of the neuroprotective effects it was shown to have in animal experiments. The purpose of this paper is to compare the adverse effects, and to describe the effects on indirect markers of renal function of long-term creatine supplementation. 175 subjects (age = 57.7 +/- 11.1 y) were randomly assigned to receive creatine monohydrate 10 g daily or placebo during an average period of 310 days. After one month, two months and from then on every fourth month, adverse effects were scored using dichotomous questionnaires, plasma urea concentrations were measured, and urinary creatine and albumin concentrations were determined. No significant differences in the occurrence at any time of adverse effects due to creatine supplementation were found (23 % nausea in the creatine group, vs. 24 % in the placebo group, 19 % gastro-intestinal discomfort in the creatine group, vs. 18 % in the placebo group, 35 % diarrhoea in the creatine group, vs. 24 % in the placebo group). After two months of treatment, oedematous limbs were seen more often in subjects using creatine, probably due to water retention. Severe diarrhoea (n = 2) and severe nausea (n = 1) caused 3 subjects in the creatine group to stop intake of creatine, after which these adverse effects subsided. Long-term supplementation of creatine did not lead to an increase of plasma urea levels (5.69 +/- 1.47 before treatment vs. 5.26 +/- 1.44 at the end of treatment) or to a higher prevalence of micro-albuminuria (5.4 % before treatment vs. 1.8 % at the end of treatment).",

          "content": "A short period of leg immobilization leads to rapid loss of muscle mass and strength. Creatine supplementation has been shown to increase lean body mass in active individuals and can be used to augment gains in muscle mass and strength during prolonged resistance-type exercise training. Our objective was to investigate whether creatine loading can attenuate the loss of muscle mass and strength during short-term leg immobilization. Healthy young men (n\u00a0=\u00a030; aged 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years; body mass index [BMI] 23.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0kg/m) were randomly assigned to either a creatine or a placebo group. Subjects received placebo or creatine supplements (20\u00a0g/d) for 5\u00a0days before one leg was immobilized by means of a full-leg cast for 7\u00a0days. Muscle biopsies were taken before creatine loading, prior to and immediately after leg immobilization, and after 7\u00a0days of subsequent recovery. Quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA) (computed tomography [CT] scan) and leg muscle strength (one-repetition maximum [1-RM] knee extension) were assessed before and immediately after immobilization and after 1\u00a0week of recovery. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data are presented consistently as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error of the mean (SEM). There was a significant overall increase in muscle total creatine content following the 5-day loading phase (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049), which appeared driven by an increase in the creatine group (from 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 to 107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0mmol/kg dry muscle) with no apparent change in the placebo group (from 88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mmol/kg; p\u00a0=\u00a00.066 for time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0treatment interaction). Quadriceps muscle CSA had declined by 465\u00a0\u00b1\u00a059 and 425\u00a0\u00b1\u00a069\u00a0mm (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the creatine and placebo group, respectively, with no differences between groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.76). Leg muscle strength decreased from 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0kg in the creatine and from 59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 to 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0kg in the placebo group, with no differences between groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.20). Muscle fiber size did not change significantly over time in either group (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). When non-responders to creatine loading were excluded (n\u00a0=\u00a06), responders (n\u00a0=\u00a08; total creatine content increasing from 70 to 106\u00a0mmol/kg) showed similar findings, with no signs of preservation of muscle mass or strength during immobilization. During the subsequent recovery phase, no differences in muscle mass or strength were found between the two groups (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Creatine supplementation prior to and during leg immobilization does not prevent or attenuate the loss of muscle mass or strength during short-term muscle disuse.

          "content": "Protein intake is essential to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis, and the amino acid leucine seems to possess a superior effect on muscle protein synthesis compared to other amino acids. Native whey has higher leucine content and thus a potentially greater anabolic effect on muscle than regular whey (WPC-80). This study compared the acute anabolic effects of ingesting 2\u2009\u00d7\u200920 g of native whey protein, WPC-80 or milk protein after a resistance exercise session. 24 young resistance trained men and women took part in this double blind, randomized, partial crossover, controlled study. Participants received either WPC-80 and native whey (\u2009=\u200910), in a crossover design, or milk (\u2009=\u200912). Supplements were ingested immediately (20\u00a0g) and two hours after (20\u00a0g) a bout of heavy-load lower body resistance exercise. Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure plasma concentrations of amino acids by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry, muscle phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting, and mixed muscle protein synthesis by use of [H]phenylalanine-infusion, gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Being the main comparison, differences between native whey and WPC-80 were analysed by a one-way ANOVA and comparisons between the whey supplements and milk were analysed by a two-way ANOVA. Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 and milk (\u2009<\u20090.05). Native whey ingestion induced a greater phosphorylation of p70S6K than milk 180\u00a0min after exercise (\u2009=\u20090.03). Muscle protein synthesis rates increased 1-3\u00a0h hours after exercise with WPC-80 (0.119%), and 1-5\u00a0h after exercise with native whey (0.112%). Muscle protein synthesis rates were higher 1-5\u00a0h after exercise with native whey than with milk (0.112% vs. 0.064, \u2009=\u20090.023). Despite higher-magnitude increases in blood leucine concentrations with native whey, it was not superior to WPC-80 concerning effect on muscle protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70S6K during a 5-h post-exercise period. Native whey increased phosphorylation of p70S6K and muscle protein synthesis rates to a greater extent than milk during the 5-h post exercise period. This study was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02968888.",

          "content": "As a relatively novel approach to enhancing skeletal muscle health, mixed protein supplementation has shown similar responses to whey protein. However, no previous studies have examined its impact on golf swing performance. This study aimed to examine the effect of mixed protein supplementation on the swing performance and muscle strength of casual golfers. Sixty participants with a handicap of less than 20 were recruited and randomly assigned to a double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. The participants were divided into two groups: a mixed protein group (MG, \u2009=\u200930), and a placebo control group (CG, \u2009=\u200930). They were instructed to ingest either a supplement containing casein calcium, whey protein, and isolated pea protein, or a placebo, once daily for 8\u2009weeks. Pre- and posttests consisted of anthropometric measurements, muscle strength (isokinetic knee and trunk strength, and handgrip strength), 2-minute push-ups, balance, and golf swing performance using a driver and 7-iron. After the 8-week supplementation period, ANCOVA, using baseline values as covariates, revealed significant differences for driver distance (\u2009=\u2009.004) and driver ball speed (\u2009<\u2009.001). MG significantly increased driver distance by 5.17\u2009\u00b1\u200912.8\u2009m (\u2009=\u2009.046), driver ball speed by 1.36\u2009\u00b1\u20092.87\u2009m/s (\u2009=\u2009.021). Additionally, significantly improvements were observed in hand grip strength (+2.12\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47\u2009kg, \u2009=\u2009.004), two-minute push-ups (+4.89\u2009\u00b1\u20098.14 reps, \u2009=\u2009.004), and balance score (-0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69\u2009min, \u2009=\u2009.009). No significant differences were observed in body composition parameters (\u2009>\u2009.05). The intake of a mixed protein containing both animal and plant proteins had positive effects on golf performance and muscle function. Therefore, mixed proteins may represent a safe and effective approach to enhancing skeletal muscle health in golf players.",

          "title": "Whey Protein Supplementation Combined with Exercise on Muscle Protein Synthesis and the AKT/mTOR Pathway in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
          "content": "The process of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) plays a pivotal role in the enhancement of muscle function. Following a bout of exercise, the rate of MPS experiences an elevation for a brief period, known as the \"anabolic window.\" Despite whey protein supplementation has been demonstrated to augment the post-exercise anabolic window, the optimal timing and dosage remain controversial. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the effects of whey protein supplementation on post-exercise MPS and its protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in healthy adults.  Following PRISMA guidelines, this review included 21 RCTs, with 15 studies subjected to meta-analysis and 6 studies to qualitative analysis. Eligible studies examined myofibrillar fractional synthetic rate (FSR) or the AKT/mTOR pathway-related protein phosphorylation levels in muscle biopsy samples.  The combination of whey protein supplementation and exercise has been shown to significantly enhance FSR (Hedge's g = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.71-1.77;  < 0.001), with increases ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 folds when consumed immediately after exercise and up to 2.5 folds when given 45 min prior to multiple-set resistance exercise. A dose-dependent increase in FSR was observed in response to whey protein supplementation, ranging from 10 to 60 g. In comparison to the placebo group, whey protein supplementation enhanced the phosphorylation levels of AKT, mTOR, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) at 1-2 h post-exercise. Phosphorylation levels of p70S6K and rpS6 decreased 4-5 h after exercise.  The combination of whey protein supplementation and exercise improves MPS in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Consumption of 20-40g of whey protein before multiple sets of resistance exercise may enhance myofibrillar FSR and activate the AKT/mTOR pathway, thereby augmenting MPS and extending the anabolic window.",

          "title": "The effects of whey, pea, and collagen protein supplementation beyond the recommended dietary allowance on integrated myofibrillar protein synthetic rates in older males: a randomized controlled trial.",
          "content": "Skeletal muscle mass is determined predominantly by feeding-induced and activity-induced fluctuations in muscle protein synthesis (MPS). Older individuals display a diminished MPS response to protein ingestion, referred to as age-related anabolic resistance, which contributes to the progression of age-related muscle loss known as sarcopenia. We aimed to determine the impact of consuming higher-quality compared with lower-quality protein supplements above the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) on integrated MPS rates. We hypothesized that increasing total protein intake above the RDA, regardless of the source, would support higher integrated rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis. Thirty-one healthy older males (72 \u00b1 4 y) consumed a controlled diet with protein intake set at the RDA: control phase (days 1-7). In a double-blind, randomized controlled fashion, participants were assigned to consume an additional 50 g (2 \u00d7 25g) of whey (n = 10), pea (n = 11), or collagen (n = 10) protein each day (25 g at breakfast and lunch) during the supplemental phase (days 8-15). Deuterated water ingestion and muscle biopsies assessed integrated MPS and acute anabolic signaling. Postprandial blood samples were collected to determine feeding-induced aminoacidemia. Integrated MPS was increased during supplemental with whey (1.59 \u00b1 0.11 %/d; P < 0.001) and pea (1.59 \u00b1 0.14 %/d; P < 0.001) when compared with RDA (1.46 \u00b1 0.09 %/d for the whey group; 1.46 \u00b1 0.10 %/d for the pea group); however, it remained unchanged with collagen. Supplemental protein was sufficient to overcome anabolic signaling deficits (mTORC1 and rpS6), corroborating the greater postprandial aminoacidemia. Our findings demonstrate that supplemental protein provided at breakfast and lunch over the current RDA enhanced anabolic signaling and integrated MPS in older males; however, the source of additional protein may be an important consideration in overcoming age-related anabolic resistance.

We aimed to elucidate how habituated amounts of protein intake affect the fasted state of, and the stimulatory effect of a protein-rich meal on, protein absorption, whole-body protein turnover, and splanchnic amino acid metabolism. Twelve men (65-70 y) were included in a double-blinded crossover intervention study, consisting of a 20-d habituation period to a protein intake at the RDA or a high amount [1.1 g \u00b7 kg lean body mass (LBM)-1 \u00b7 d-1 or >2.1 g \u00b7 kg LBM-1 \u00b7 d-1, respectively], each followed by an experimental trial with a primed, constant infusion of D8-phenylalanine and D2-tyrosine. Arterial and hepatic venous blood samples were obtained after an overnight fast and repeatedly 4 h after a standardized meal including intrinsically labeled whey protein concentrate and calcium-caseinate proteins. Blood was analyzed for amino acid concentrations and phenylalanine and tyrosine tracer enrichments from which whole-body and splanchnic amino acid and protein kinetics were calculated. High (compared with the recommended amount of) protein intake resulted in a higher fasting whole-body protein turnover with a resultant mean \u00b1 SEM 0.03 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg LBM-1 \u00b7 min-1 lower net balance (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which was not rescued by the intake of a protein-dense meal.

Furthermore, higher fasting and postprandial amino acid removal were observed after habituation to high protein, yielding higher urea excretion and increased phenylalanine oxidation rates (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Three weeks of habituation to high protein intake (>2.1 g protein \u00b7 kg LBM-1 \u00b7 d-1) led to a significantly higher net protein loss in the fasted state.

However, whey protein (WP) may induce bone formation because of its basic component, milk basic protein. This study assessed the effects of WP supplementation, TPro, and change in TPro (postsupplementation - presupplementation) on BMD and bone mineral content (BMC; total body, lumbar spine, total femur, and femoral neck) in overweight and class I obese middle-aged adults following an exercise intervention. This analysis used data from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 36-wk WP supplementation trial, wherein participants consumed a 1.7-MJ (400-kcal) supplement (0, 20, 40, or 60 g WP/d) along with their otherwise unrestricted diet while participating in a resistance and aerobic exercise intervention (3 d/wk). TPro was the summation of WP and habitual dietary intakes (4-d food record). Statistical analyses for WP were based on group and bone data [n = 186, 108 women; mean \u00b1 SD age: 49 \u00b1 8 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m): 30.1 \u00b1 2.8], whereas TPro was based on dietary and bone data (n = 113, 70 women; age 50 \u00b1 8 y; BMI 30.1 \u00b1 2.9). WP supplementation, regardless of dose, did not influence BMD or BMC following the intervention. By using a multiple linear regression model, TPro (expressed as g/d or g \u00b7 kg \u00b7 d) and change in TPro (expressed as g/d) were not associated with responses over time in total or regional BMD or BMC.

Augmentation of protein intake with leucine may enhance the muscle protein synthetic response in older women to aid in maintaining muscle mass. We measured the acute (hourly) and integrated (daily) myofibrillar protein synthesis (myoPS) response to consumption of a high-quality mixed protein beverage compared with an isonitrogenous protein beverage with added leucine. In a parallel design, free-living, healthy older women (aged 65-75 y, n = 11/group) consumed a fixed, weight-maintaining diet with protein at 1.0 g \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1 and were randomly assigned to twice-daily consumption of either 15 g milk protein beverage containing 4.2 g leucine (LEU) or 15 g mixed protein (milk and soy) beverage containing 1.3 g leucine (CON). Unilateral leg resistance exercise allowed a determination of acute ([13C6]-phenylalanine infusion, hourly rate) and integrated (deuterated water ingestion, daily rate) exercised and rested myoPS responses. Acute myoPS increased in response to feeding in the rested (CON: 13% \u00b1 4%; LEU: 53% \u00b1 5%) and exercised (CON: 30% \u00b1 4%; LEU: 87% \u00b1 7%) leg in both groups, but the increase was greater in LEU (P < 0.001). Integrated myoPS increased during the supplementation period in both legs (rested: 9% \u00b11%; exercised: 17% \u00b1 2%; P < 0.001) in LEU, but in the exercised leg only (7% \u00b1 2%; P < 0.001) in CON. A 15-g protein-containing beverage with \u223c4 g leucine induced greater increases in acute and integrated myoPS than did an isonitrogenous, isoenergetic mixed-protein beverage.

To investigate the effect of protein supplementation alone or combined with light-intensity or heavy-load resistance exercise on muscle size, strength, and function in older adults. In a 1-y randomized controlled trial, 208 healthy older adults (>65 y) were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 interventions: 1) carbohydrate supplementation (CARB); 2) collagen protein supplementation (COLL); 3) whey protein supplementation (WHEY); 4) light-intensity resistance training 3-5 times/wk with whey protein supplementation (LITW); and 5) heavy resistance training 3 times weekly with whey protein supplementation (HRTW). Protein supplements contained 20 g protein\u00a0+\u00a010 g carbohydrate, whereas CARB contained 30 g of carbohydrates. All intervention groups received the supplement twice daily. The primary outcome was change in the quadriceps cross-sectional area (qCSA). Secondary outcomes included measures of lower extremity strength and power, functional capabilities, and body composition. There were 184 participants who completed the study. COLL and WHEY did not affect any measured parameter compared to CARB. Compared to WHEY, HRTW improved the qCSA size (between-group difference, +1.68 cm2; 95% CI, +0.41 to +2.95 cm2; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), as well as dynamic (+18.4 Nm; 95% CI, +10.1 to +26.6 Nm; P\u00a0<\u00a010-4) and isometric knee extensor strength (+23.9 Nm; 95% CI, +14.2 to +33.6 Nm; P\u00a0<\u00a010-5). LITW did not improve the qCSA size, but increased dynamic knee extensor strength compared to WHEY (+13.7 Nm; 95% CI, +5.3 and +22.1 Nm; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Recommending protein supplementation as a stand-alone intervention for healthy older individuals seems ineffective in improving muscle mass and strength. Only HRTW was effective in both preserving muscle mass and increasing strength. Thus, we recommend that future studies investigate strategies to increase long-term compliance to heavy resistance exercise in healthy older adults.

          "content": "Few studies have evaluated protein intake and bone loss in elders. Excess protein may be associated with negative calcium balance, whereas low protein intake has been associated with fracture. We examined the relation between baseline dietary protein and subsequent 4-year change in bone mineral density (BMD) for 391 women and 224 men from the population-based Framingham Osteoporosis Study. BMD (g/cm2) was assessed in 1988-1989 and in 1992-1993 at the femur, spine, and radius. Usual dietary protein intake was determined using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and expressed as percent of energy from protein intake. BMD loss over 4 years was regressed on percent protein intake, simultaneously adjusting for other baseline factors: age, weight, height, weight change, total energy intake, smoking, alcohol intake, caffeine, physical activity, calcium intake, and, for women, current estrogen use. Effects of animal protein on bone loss also were examined. Mean age at baseline (+/-SD) of 615 participants was 75 years (+/-4.4; range, 68-91 years). Mean protein intake was 68 g/day (+/-24.0; range, 14-175 g/day), and mean percent of energy from protein was 16% (+/-3.4; range, 7-30%). Proportional protein intakes were similar for men and women. Lower protein intake was significantly related to bone loss at femoral and spine sites (p < or = 0.04) with effects similar to 10 lb of weight. Persons in the lowest quartile of protein intake showed the greatest bone loss. Similar to the overall protein effect, lower percent animal protein also was significantly related to bone loss at femoral and spine BMD sites (all p < 0.01) but not the radial shaft (p = 0.23). Even after controlling for known confounders including weight loss, women and men with relatively lower protein intake had increased bone loss, suggesting that protein intake is important in maintaining bone or minimizing bone loss in elderly persons. Further, higher intake of animal protein does not appear to affect the skeleton adversely in this elderly population.",

          "content": "It has been proposed that protein supplementation during resistance exercise training enhances muscle hypertrophy. The degree of hypertrophy during training is controlled in part through the activation of satellite cells and myonuclear accretion. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of protein supplementation (and the type of protein) during traditional resistance training on myofiber cross-sectional area, satellite cell content, and myonuclear addition. Healthy young men participated in supervised whole-body progressive resistance training 3 d\u00b7wk for 12 wk. Participants were randomized to one of three groups ingesting a daily 22-g macronutrient dose of soy-dairy protein blend (PB, n = 22), whey protein isolate (WP, n = 15), or an isocaloric maltodextrin placebo (MDP, n = 17). Lean mass, vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional area, satellite cell content, and myonuclear addition were assessed before and after resistance training. PB and the pooled protein treatments (PB + WP = PRO) exhibited a greater whole-body lean mass %change compared with MDP (P = 0.057 for PB) and (P = 0.050 for PRO), respectively. All treatments demonstrated similar leg muscle hypertrophy and vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional area (P < 0.05). Increases in myosin heavy chain I and II myofiber satellite cell content and myonuclei content were also detected after exercise training (P < 0.05). Protein supplementation during resistance training has a modest effect on whole-body lean mass as compared with exercise training without protein supplementation, and there was no effect on any outcome between protein supplement types (blend vs whey). However, protein supplementation did not enhance resistance exercise-induced increases in myofiber hypertrophy, satellite cell content, or myonuclear addition in young healthy men. We propose that as long as protein intake is adequate during muscle overload, the adaptations in muscle growth and function will not be influenced by protein supplementation.",

Few studies have examined the separate effects of soy protein and isoflavones. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of soy protein and isoflavones on plasma lipid concentrations in postmenopausal, moderately hypercholesterolemic women. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 3 treatment groups. After a 4-wk run-in phase during which the women consumed a milk protein supplement, the subjects were randomly assigned to 12 wk of dietary protein supplementation (42 g/d) with either a milk protein (Milk group) or 1 of 2 soy proteins containing either trace amounts of isoflavones (Soy- group) or 80 mg aglycone isoflavones (Soy+ group). LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased more in the Soy+ group (n = 31) than in the Soy- group (n = 33) (0.38 compared with 0.09 mmol/L; P = 0.005), but neither of these changes was significantly different from the 0.26-mmol/L decrease observed in the Milk group (n = 30). The results for total cholesterol were similar to those for LDL cholesterol. There were no significant differences in HDL-cholesterol or triacylglycerol concentrations between the 3 groups. The difference in total- and LDL-cholesterol lowering between the 2 soy-protein supplements suggests an effect attributable to the isoflavone-containing fraction. However, the unexpected LDL-cholesterol lowering observed in the Milk group, and the fact that there was no significant difference between either soy group and the Milk group, suggests that changes may have been due to other factors related to participation in the study.",

A 12-month randomized controlled double blind trial with a 43-month of post-trial follow-up. Porvoo, Finland. A total of 218 older (>74\u00a0years of age) community-dwelling people with sarcopenia. (1) Control with no supplementation; (2) isocaloric placebo; and (3) 20\u00a0g\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 whey-enriched protein supplementation. All participants were given instructions on home-based exercise, dietary protein, and vitamin D supplementation of 20\u00a0\u03bcg/d. Physical performance was assessed by short physical performance battery and continuous summary physical performance scores. Hand grip strength and calf intracellular resistance based skeletal muscle index were measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy. The measurements were performed at 0, 6, and 12\u00a0months. The post-trial follow-up was performed by a postal questionnaire and national census record data. The participants were older (75-96\u00a0years of age) and mostly women (68%). The test supplements had no significant effects on physical performance; the 12-month changes for short physical performance battery were\u00a0-0.55,\u00a0-.05, and 0.03 points in control, isocaloric, and protein groups (P\u00a0=\u00a0.17), respectively. The changes in continuous summary physical performance scores were similar between the intervention groups (P\u00a0=\u00a0.76). The hand grip strength decreased significantly in all intervention groups, and the 12-month changes in calf intracellular resistance-based skeletal muscle index were minor and there were no differences between the intervention groups. One-half of the patients (56%) in both supplement groups reported mild gastrointestinal adverse effects. Differences were found neither in the all-cause mortality nor physical functioning in the post-trial follow-up. The whey-enriched protein supplementation in combination with low intensity home-based physical exercise did not attenuate the deterioration of muscle and physical performance in community-dwelling older people with sarcopenia.",

This study identified the utility of the phase angle (PhA) to estimate muscle health, and evaluated its changes following intradialytic neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and oral nutritional supplement interventions in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. This post-hoc analysis was conducted using data obtained from a 12-week multicenter randomized trial that examined the effects of NMES and protein supplementation. The participants were divided into four groups according to intradialytic NMES and protein supplementation. The PhA, muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance were measured every 4 weeks. Overall, 59 participants completed the study. PhA values were linearly associated with muscle mass and muscle strength. Additionally, high PhA levels indicated fast gait speed and shortened timed up-and-go test (TUG) results. We further evaluated the association between the PhA slope and muscle health-related parameters. In participants with the PhA slope &lt;0\u00b0 over 12 weeks, TUG results worsened over time, relative to those with a slope \u22650\u00b0 over 12 weeks, independent of age, sex, diabetes, and body mass index. NMES did not improve the PhA values over time; however, protein supplementation tended to increase the PhA values. PhA is a reliable marker for estimating and monitoring muscle health in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, and a strong association exists between PhA and TUG results.",

          "content": "The ergogenic effects of caffeine intake on exercise performance are well-established, even if differences exist among individuals in response to caffeine intake. The genetic variation of a specific gene, human cytochrome P450 enzyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) (rs762551), may be one reason for this difference. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the influence of CYP1A2 gene types on athletes' exercise performance after caffeine intake. A literature search through 4 databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) was conducted until March 2023. The effect size was expressed as the weighted mean difference (WMD) by calculating fixed effects meta-analysis if heterogeneity was not significant (I \u2264 50% and p \u2265 0.1). Subgroup analyses were performed based on AA and AC/CC genotype of CYP1A2. The final number of studies meeting the inclusion criteria was 12 (n\u202f=\u202f666 participants). The overall analysis showed that the cycling time trial significantly improved after caffeine intake (WMD\u202f=\u202f-0.48, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): -0.83 to -0.13, p\u202f=\u202f0.007). In subgroup analyses, acute caffeine intake improved cycling time trial only in individuals with the A allele (WMD\u202f=\u202f-0.90, 95%CI: -1.48 to -0.33, p\u202f=\u202f0.002), but not the C allele (WMD\u202f=\u202f-0.08, 95%CI: -0.32 to 0.17, p\u202f=\u202f0.53). Caffeine supplementation did not influence the Wingate (WMD\u202f=\u202f8.07, 95%CI: -22.04 to 38.18, p\u202f=\u202f0.60) or countermovement jump test (CMJ) performance (WMD\u202f=\u202f1.17, 95%CI: -0.02 to 2.36, p\u202f=\u202f0.05), and these outcomes were not influenced by CYP1A2 genotype. Participants with the CYP1A2 genotype with A allele improved their cycling time trials after caffeine supplementation. However, compared to placebo, acute caffeine supplementation failed to increase the Wingate or CMJ performance, regardless of CYP1A2 genotype.",

          "content": "Caffeine, identified as a central nervous system stimulant in foods, beverages (coffee, tea, chocolate), and medications, has been focused on its ergogenic properties, enhancing physical performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the caffeine intake (from coffee) and fat-free mass index (FFMI). We carried out a cohort study that included 3,466 women and 3,145 men aged \u226520\u2009years who were intaking caffeine. Caffeine intake from coffee were obtained from two 24-hour dietary recall interviews. The FFMI was calculated as FFM (kg) divided by height in m. The caffeine intake was classified into quartiles and combined into 4 groups. Multiple linear regression model analysis and multiple logistic regression model analysis were used to assess associations between the caffeine and FFMI adjusted for potential confounders. Among the 2,427 participants, males accounted for 52.4%, and females 47.6%. In multiple linear regression model, Model 1 (unadjusted Model (\u2009=\u20090.041)) and Model 2 (adjusted for age, race, and BMI (\u2009=\u20090.006)) in women showed a significant relationship between caffeine intake and FFMI. In multivariable models, caffeine intake and FFMI were significantly different (\u2009<\u20090.05). In sex subgroups, among females, each quartile of caffeine intake was positively correlated with FFMI levels in the average FFMI group in Model 3 (\u2009<\u20090.001). In age subgroups, each quartile of caffeine intake was positively correlated with FFMI levels in the average FFMI group in Model 3 for individuals aged 20-40 (\u2009=\u20090.039) and those aged above 40 (\u2009=\u20090.016). In drinking status subgroups, if they drunk alcohol, each quartile was positively correlated with FFMI levels in the average FFMI group in Model 3 (\u2009<\u20090.001). Caffeine intake was mainly positively associated with FFMI, especially in women with above levels of FFMI. Longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to establish causality and provide evidence-based recommendations regarding caffeine intake to optimize muscle health.",

The impact of daily caffeine intake-a ritual shared by 80% of the population worldwide-and of its discontinuation on working memory and its neural correlates remained unknown. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, we examined working memory functions in 20 young healthy non-smokers (age: 26.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0\u00a0years; body mass index: 22.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u00a0kg/m; and habitual caffeine intake: 474.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009107.5\u00a0mg/day) in a 10-day caffeine (150\u00a0mg\u2009\u00d7\u20093 times/day), a 10-day placebo (3 times/day), and a withdrawal condition (9-day caffeine followed by 1-day placebo). Throughout the 10th day of each condition, participants performed four times a working memory task (N-Back, comprising 3- and 0-back), and task-related blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity was measured in the last session with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to placebo, participants showed a higher error rate and a longer reaction time in 3- against 0-back trials in the caffeine condition; also, in the withdrawal condition we observed a higher error rate compared to placebo. However, task-related BOLD activity, i.e., an increased attention network and decreased default mode network activity in 3- versus 0-back, did not show significant differences among three conditions. Interestingly, irrespective of 3- or 0-back, BOLD activity was reduced in the right hippocampus in the caffeine condition compared to placebo. Adding to the earlier evidence showing increasing cerebral metabolic demands for WM function after acute caffeine intake, our data suggest that such demands might be impeded over daily intake and therefore result in a worse performance. Finally, the reduced hippocampal activity may reflect caffeine-associated hippocampal grey matter plasticity reported in the previous analysis. The findings of this study reveal an adapted neurocognitive response to daily caffeine exposure and highlight the importance of classifying impacts of caffeine on clinical and healthy populations.",

          "content": "The aim was to quantify the proportion of the literature on caffeine supplementation that reports habitual caffeine consumption, and determine the influence of habitual consumption on the acute exercise response to caffeine supplementation, using a systematic review and meta-analytic approach. Three databases were searched, and articles screened according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Three-level meta-analyses and meta-regression models were used to investigate the influence of habitual caffeine consumption on caffeine's overall ergogenic effect and within different exercise types (endurance, power, strength), in men and women, and in trained and untrained individuals. Sub-analyses were performed according to the following: acute relative dose (<\u20093, 3-6, >\u20096\u00a0mg/kg body mass [BM]); whether the acute caffeine dose provided was lower or higher than the mean daily caffeine dose; and the caffeine withdrawal period prior to the intervention (<\u200924, 24-48, >\u200948\u00a0h). Sixty caffeine studies included sufficient information on habitual consumption to be included in the meta-analysis. A positive overall effect of caffeine was shown in comparison to placebo (standard mean difference [SMD]\u2009=\u20090.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.30; p\u2009<\u20090.001) with no influence of relative habitual caffeine consumption (p\u2009=\u20090.59). Subgroup analyses showed a significant ergogenic effect when the caffeine dose was\u2009<\u20093\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.40; p\u2009=\u20090.003) and 3-6\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.21-0.32; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), but not\u2009>\u20096\u00a0mg/kg BM (SMD\u2009=\u20090.11, 95% CI\u2009-\u20090.07 to 0.30; p\u2009=\u20090.23); when the dose was both higher (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.20-0.31; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and lower (SMD\u2009=\u20090.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.36; p\u2009=\u20090.006) than the habitual caffeine dose; and when withdrawal was\u2009<\u200924\u00a0h, 24-48\u00a0h, and\u2009>\u200948\u00a0h. Caffeine was effective for endurance, power, and strength exercise, with no influence (all p\u2009\u2265\u20090.23) of relative habitual caffeine consumption within exercise types.

After adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking, alcohol drinking, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin, hypertension, and total energy intake, ln-transformed 1-methyluric acid (1-MU) (OR\u2009=\u20091.27, 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.56, P\u2009=\u20090.016) and 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil (AAMU) (OR\u2009=\u20091.16, 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.34, P\u2009=\u20090.043) were associated with an increased DR risk. In median analysis, compared to lower levels (\u2264\u200950%), higher levels (>\u200950%) of 1,7-dimethyluric acid (1,7-DMU) (OR\u2009=\u20091.92, 95% CI, 1.20 to 3.09, P\u2009=\u20090.008), caffeine (OR\u2009=\u20092.00, 95% CI, 1.27 to 3.16, P\u2009=\u20090.004), and AAMU (OR\u2009=\u20091.48, 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.10, P\u2009=\u20090.029) were associated with an increased DR risk. Sex-based analysis showed that ln-transformed 1-MU (OR\u2009=\u20091.48, 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.98, P\u2009=\u20090.012), 1,3,7-TMU (OR\u2009=\u20091.24, 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.49, P\u2009=\u20090.018) and caffeine (OR\u2009=\u20091.29, 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.60, P\u2009=\u20090.028) were associated with an increased DR risk in males. Compared to lower levels (\u2264\u200950%), higher levels (>\u200950%) of 1,7-DMU (OR\u2009=\u20092.75, 95% CI, 1.33 to 5.70, P\u2009=\u20090.008), 1,3,7-TMU (OR\u2009=\u20092.26, 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.01, P\u2009=\u20090.044), caffeine (OR\u2009=\u20093.23, 95% CI, 1.53 to 6.82, P\u2009=\u20090.003), and AAMU (OR\u2009=\u20092.93, 95% CI, 1.16 to 7.40, P\u2009=\u20090.024) were associated with an increased DR risk in males. This study indicated that high urinary levels of 1-MU, 1,7-DMU, 1,3,7-TMU, caffeine and AAMU were associated with an increased risk of DR in US males with DM. Prospective studies are needed to verify these findings.",

          "content": "This study investigated the effect of caffeine on physical performance in healthy citizens aged > or =70 yr. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted in 15 men and 15 women recruited by their general practitioner. Participants abstained from caffeine for 48 h and were randomized to receive one capsule of placebo and then caffeine (6 mg/kg) or caffeine and then placebo with 1 wk in between. One hour after intervention, we measured reaction and movement times, postural stability, walking speed, cycling at 65% of expected maximal heart rate, perceived effort during cycling, maximal isometric arm flexion strength, and endurance. Analysis was by intention to treat, and P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Caffeine increased cycling endurance by 25% [95% confidence interval (CI): 13-38; P = 0.0001] and isometric arm flexion endurance by 54% (95% CI: 29-83; P = 0.0001). Caffeine also reduced the rating of perceived exertion after 5 min of cycling by 11% (95% CI: 5-17; P = 0.002) and postural stability with eyes open by 25% (95% CI: 2-53; P = 0.03). Caffeine ingestion did not affect muscle strength, walking speed, reaction, and movement times. At the end of the study, 46% of participants correctly identified when they received caffeine and placebo. Caffeine increased exercise endurance in healthy citizens aged > or =70 yr, but the participants' reasons for stopping the test may have varied between subjects, as the cycling test was done at approximately 55% of maximal oxygen consumption. Further studies are required to investigate whether caffeine can be utilized to improve the physical performance of elderly citizens.",

          "content": "To investigate the relations between caffeine-derived metabolites (methylxanthines) and plasma lipids by use of population-based data from 2 European countries. Families were randomly selected from the general population of northern Belgium (FLEMENGHO), from August 12, 1985, until November 22, 1990, and 3 Swiss cities (SKIPOGH), from November 25, 2009, through April 4, 2013. We measured plasma concentrations (FLEMENGHO, SKIPOGH) and 24-hour urinary excretions (SKIPOGH) of 4 methylxanthines-caffeine, paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline-using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We used enzymatic methods to estimate total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and the Friedewald equation for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in plasma. We applied sex-specific mixed models to investigate associations between methylxanthines and plasma lipids, adjusting for major confounders. In both FLEMENGHO (N=1987; 1055 [53%] female participants) and SKIPOGH (N=990; 523 [53%] female participants), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels increased across quartiles of plasma caffeine, paraxanthine, and theophylline (total cholesterol levels by caffeine quartiles in FLEMENGHO, male participants: 5.01\u00b10.06 mmol/L, 5.05\u00b10.06 mmol/L, 5.27\u00b10.06 mmol/L, 5.62\u00b10.06 mmol/L; female participants: 5.24\u00b10.06 mmol/L, 5.15\u00b10.05 mmol/L, 5.25\u00b10.05 mmol/L, 5.42\u00b10.05 mmol/L). Similar results were observed using urinary methylxanthines in SKIPOGH (total cholesterol levels by caffeine quartiles, male participants: 4.54\u00b10.08 mmol/L, 4.94\u00b10.08 mmol/L, 4.87\u00b10.08 mmol/L, 5.27\u00b10.09 mmol/L; female participants: 5.12\u00b10.07 mmol/L, 5.21\u00b10.07 mmol/L, 5.28\u00b10.05 mmol/L, 5.28\u00b10.07 mmol/L). Furthermore, urinary caffeine and theophylline were positively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in SKIPOGH male participants. Plasma and urinary caffeine, paraxanthine, and theophylline were positively associated with plasma lipids, whereas the associations involving theobromine were less clear. We postulate that the positive association between caffeine intake and plasma lipids may be related to the sympathomimetic function of methylxanthines, mitigating the overall health-beneficial effect of caffeine intake.",

          "content": "Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the research literature assessing the effect of caffeine ingestion on maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) strength and muscular endurance. Thirty-four relevant studies between 1939 and 2008 were included in the meta-analyses of caffeine's effects on MVC strength (n = 27 studies) and muscular endurance (n = 23 studies). Effect sizes (ES) were calculated as the standardized mean difference and meta-analyses were completed using a random-effects model. Overall, caffeine ingestion was found to result in a small beneficial effect on MVC strength (overall ES = 0.19, P = 0.0003). However, caffeine appears to improve MVC strength primarily in the knee extensors (i.e., by approximately 7%, ES = 0.37) and not in other muscle groups such as the forearm or the knee flexors. In an attempt to offer a physiological mechanism behind caffeine's ability to improve MVC strength, a meta-analysis was run on ES from nine studies that measured percent muscle activation during MVC in trials comparing caffeine versus placebo; the overall ES (0.67) was highly significant (P = 0.00008) and of moderate to large size, thus implicating an effect of caffeine on the CNS. Caffeine ingestion was also found to exert a small beneficial effect on muscular endurance (overall ES = 0.28, P = 0.00005). However, it appears caffeine improves muscular endurance only when it is assessed using open (i.e., by approximately 18%, ES = 0.37) and not fixed end point tests. Overall, caffeine ingestion improves MVC strength and muscular endurance. The effect on strength appears exclusively in the knee extensors, and the effect on muscular endurance appears only detectable with open end point tests.",

          "content": "Caffeine has been purported to have anxiogenic and panicogenic properties, specifically salient in patients with panic disorder (PD). However, compilations of the magnitude of the effect of caffeine on anxiety and panic attacks are lacking and potential dose-response relationships have not been examined. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to examine the acute effects of placebo-controlled caffeine challenge on occurrence of panic attacks and subjective anxiety in patients with PD and healthy controls (HC), including dose-response relationships. Systematic searches were performed in six databases. We included blinded placebo-controlled studies of acute caffeine challenge on panic attacks and/or subjective anxiety in adult patients with PD. Of the 1893 identified articles, ten met our inclusion criteria. The 9 studies investigating panic attacks included 237 patients, of which 51.1% had a panic attack following caffeine, but none after placebo. Six of these studies compared 128 patients with 115 healthy controls (HC), finding that patients (53.9%) were more vulnerable than HC (1.7%) for panic attacks following caffeine (log RR: 3.47; 95% CI 2.06-4.87). Six studies investigated subjective anxiety in 121 patients and 111 HC following caffeine, with an overall effect indicating increased sensitivity to the anxiogenic effects of caffeine in the patient group (Hedges' g\u00a0=\u00a01.02 [95% CI: 0.09-1.96]). The restricted range of caffeine employed [400-750\u00a0mg] and few studies (3) not using 480\u00a0mg prevented any meaningful analysis of a dose-response relationship. Of the ten studies included, only 2 reported anxiety data for the placebo condition, precluding a proper meta-analysis comparing anxiogenic effects of caffeine and placebo. The restricted dose range used prevented assessment of dose-response relationships. The results confirm that caffeine at doses roughly equivalent to 5 cups of coffee induces panic attacks in a large proportion of PD patients and highly discriminates this population from healthy adults. Caffeine also increases anxiety in PD patients as well as among healthy adults at these doses although the exact relationship between caffeine-induced anxiety and panic attacks remains uncertain. The results suggest that caffeine targets important mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of PD. Future studies should employ a wider range of caffeine doses and investigate contributions of biological and psychological mechanisms underlying the anxiogenic and panicogenic effects of caffeine. In the clinic, patients with PD should be informed about the panicogenic and anxiogenic effects of caffeine, with the caveat that little is known regarding smaller doses than 480\u00a0mg.

A total of 579 individuals aged 6-19\u00a0years with available data on urinary caffeine and its metabolites, as well as serum hormones [total testosterone (TT), estradiol (E), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)], were included. Additionally, the free androgen index (FAI) was calculated as TT/SHBG, and the ratio of TT to E (TT/E) was estimated. Puberty status was defined based on hormone levels (TT\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0ng/dL in males and E2\u2009\u2265\u200920\u00a0pg/ml in females for high steroid hormone levels; otherwise considered prepuberty). Linear regression, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, and Q-gcomp analyses were performed to estimate the associations of individual chemicals or chemical mixtures with sex hormones. Linear regression analyses indicated inverse associations between 12 and 15 caffeine metabolites with SHBG levels in male children and prepubertal boys, respectively. Furthermore, WQS regression demonstrated that caffeine mixtures were inversely associated with E and TT levels in male adolescents and prepubertal boys. Similar results were observed with Q-gcomp analysis. Exposure to caffeine and its metabolites, either individually or as a mixture, was inversely associated with SHBG levels in male children and prepubertal boys. Additionally, caffeine mixtures were associated with decreased levels of E and TT in male adolescents and prepubertal boys.",

          "content": "The aim of this study was to systematically review evidence on the prevalence and magnitude of side effects associated with caffeine supplementation in athletes. Systematic searches through the PubMed, VHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Peer-reviewed articles written in English that reported the prevalence/percentage or magnitude/effect size of side effects after caffeine supplementation in athletes in a sports context were included. Studies were grouped by the dose of caffeine administered as follows: low\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2264\u20093.0\u00a0mg/kg; moderate\u2009=\u2009from 3.1 to 6.0\u00a0mg/kg; high\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2265\u20096.1\u00a0mg/kg. The magnitude of the side effects was calculated with effect sizes. The search retrieved 25 studies that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria with a pooled sample of 421 participants. The supplementation with caffeine produced a higher prevalence or magnitude of all side effects under investigation when compared to placebo/control situations. The prevalence (magnitude) was between 6 and 34% (ES between 0.13 and 1.11) for low doses of caffeine, between 0 and 34% (ES between -0.13 and 1.20) for moderate doses of caffeine, and between 8 and 83% (ES between 0.04 and 1.52) with high doses of caffeine. The presence of tachycardia/heart palpitations and the negative effects on sleep onset had the highest prevalence and magnitude, in athletes using supplementation with caffeine. In summary, caffeine supplementation in the doses habitually used to enhance physical performance produces several side effects, both after exercise and at least 24\u00a0h after the ingestion. However, the prevalence and magnitude of side effects with high doses of caffeine were habitually higher than with low doses of caffeine. From a practical perspective, using\u2009~3.0\u00a0mg/kg of caffeine may be the dose of choice to obtain the ergogenic benefits of caffeine with the lowest prevalence and magnitude of side effects.",

We measured presence, duration, and reversal of adverse symptoms and cardiac events following regadenoson administration in consecutive patients randomized to IV aminophylline (100\u00a0mg administered over 30-60\u00a0seconds), IV caffeine citrate (60\u00a0mg infused over 3-5\u00a0minutes), or PO caffeine as coffee or diet cola. Of 241 patients, 152 (63%) received regadenoson reversal intervention. Complete (CR), predominant (PRE), or partial (PR) reversal was observed in 99%. CR by IV aminophylline (87%), IV caffeine (87%), and PO caffeine (78%) were similar (P\u00a0=\u00a0NS). Time to CR (162\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.6\u00a0seconds, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) was similar in treatment arms. PO caffeine was inferior to IV aminophylline for CR\u00a0+\u00a0PRE. IV aminophylline and IV caffeine provide rapid, safe reversal of regadenoson-induced adverse effects during SPECT MPI. Oral caffeine appeared similarly effective for CR but not for the combined CR\u00a0+\u00a0PRE. Our results suggest PO caffeine may be an effective initial strategy for reversal of regadenoson, but IV aminophylline or IV caffeine should be available to optimize symptom reversal as needed.",

          "title": "Strategies for cessation of caffeine administration in preterm infants.",
          "content": "Apnea and intermittent hypoxemia (IH) are common developmental disorders in infants born earlier than 37 weeks' gestation. Caffeine administration has been shown to lower the incidence of these disorders in preterm infants. Cessation of caffeine treatment is based on different post-menstrual ages (PMA) and resolution of symptoms. There is uncertainty about the best timing for caffeine discontinuation. To evaluate the effects of early versus late discontinuation of caffeine administration in preterm infants. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and three trial registries in August 2023; we applied no date limits. We checked the references of included studies and related systematic reviews. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in preterm infants born earlier than 37 weeks' gestation, up to a PMA of 44 weeks and 0 days, who received caffeine for any indication for at least seven days. We compared three different strategies for caffeine cessation: 1. at different PMAs, 2. before or after five days without symptoms, and 3. at a predetermined PMA versus at the resolution of symptoms. We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were: restarting caffeine therapy, intubation within one week of treatment discontinuation, and the need for non-invasive respiratory support within one week of treatment discontinuation. Secondary outcomes were: number of episodes of apnea in the seven days after treatment discontinuation, number of infants with at least one episode of apnea in the seven days after treatment discontinuation, number of episodes of intermittent hypoxemia (IH) within seven days of treatment discontinuation, number of infants with at least one episode of IH in the seven days after of treatment discontinuation, all-cause mortality prior to hospital discharge, major neurodevelopmental disability, number of days of respiratory support after treatment discontinuation, duration of hospital stay, and cost of neonatal care. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. We included three RCTs (392 preterm infants). Discontinuation of caffeine at PMA less than 35 weeks' gestation versus PMA equal to or longer than 35 weeks' gestation This comparison included one single completed RCT with 98 premature infants with a gestational age between 25 + 0 and 32 + 0 weeks at birth. All infants had discontinued caffeine treatment for five days at randomization. The infants received either an oral loading dose of caffeine citrate (20 mg/kg) at randomization followed by oral maintenance dosage (6 mg/kg/day) until 40 weeks PMA, or usual care (controls), during which caffeine was stopped before 37 weeks PMA. Early cessation of caffeine administration in preterm infants at PMA less than 35 weeks' gestation may result in an increase in the number of IH episodes in the seven days after discontinuation of treatment, compared to prolonged caffeine treatment beyond 35 weeks' gestation (mean difference [MD] 4.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.21 to 7.39; 1 RCT, 98 infants; low-certainty evidence). Early cessation may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality prior to hospital discharge compared to late discontinuation after 35 weeks PMA (risk ratio [RR] not estimable; 98 infants; low-certainty evidence). No data were available for the following outcomes: restarting caffeine therapy, intubation within one week of treatment discontinuation, need for non-invasive respiratory support within one week of treatment discontinuation, number of episodes of apnea, number of infants with at least one episode of apnea in the seven days after discontinuation of treatment, or number of infants with at least one episode of IH in the seven days after discontinuation of treatment. Discontinuation based on PMA versus resolution of symptoms This comparison included two RCTs with a total of 294 preterm infants. Discontinuing caffeine at the resolution of symptoms compared to discontinuing treatment at a predetermined PMA may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality prior to hospital discharge (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.03; 2 studies, 294 participants; low-certainty evidence), or in the number of infants with at least one episode of apnea within the seven days after discontinuing treatment (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.18; 2 studies; 294 infants; low-certainty evidence). Discontinuing caffeine based on the resolution of symptoms probably results in more infants with IH in the seven days after discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.75; 1 study; 174 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No data were available for the following outcomes: restarting caffeine therapy, intubation within one week of treatment discontinuation, need for non-invasive respiratory support within one week of treatment discontinuation, or number of episodes of IH in the seven days after treatment discontinuation. Adverse effects In the Rhein 2014 study, five of the infants randomized to caffeine had the caffeine treatment discontinued at the discretion of the clinical team, because of tachycardia. The Pradhap 2023 study reported adverse events, including recurrence of apnea of prematurity (15% in the short and 13% in the regular course caffeine therapy group), varying severities of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, hyperglycemia, extrauterine growth restriction, retinopathy of prematurity requiring laser treatment, feeding intolerance, osteopenia, and tachycardia, with no significant differences between the groups. The Prakash 2021 study reported that adverse effects of caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity included tachycardia, feeding intolerance, and potential neurodevelopmental impacts, though most were mild and transient. We identified three ongoing studies. There may be little or no difference in the incidence of all-cause mortality and apnea in infants who were randomized to later discontinuation of caffeine treatment. However, the number of infants with at least one episode of IH was probably reduced with later cessation. No data were found to evaluate the benefits and harms of later caffeine discontinuation for: restarting caffeine therapy, intubation within one week of treatment discontinuation, or need for non-invasive respiratory support within one week of treatment discontinuation. Further studies are needed to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of different caffeine cessation strategies in premature infants.",

Recent epidemiological studies suggest a protective effect for caffeine intake in dementia. We aimed to quantify the association between caffeine dietary intake and cognitive decline, in a cohort of adults living in Porto. A cohort of 648 subjects aged > or =65 years was recruited between 1999-2003. Follow-up evaluation (2005-2008) was carried out on 58.2% of the eligible participants and 10.9% were deceased. Caffeine exposure in the year preceding baseline evaluation was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. Cognitive evaluation consisted of baseline and follow-up Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Cognitive decline was defined by a decrease > or =2 points in the MMSE score between evaluations. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) estimates adjusted for age, education, smoking, alcohol drinking, body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes were computed using Poisson regression. Caffeine intake (> 62 mg/day [3rd third] vs. < 22 mg/day [1st third]) was associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline in women (RR=0.49, 95%CI 0.24-0.97), but not significantly in men (RR=0.65, 95%CI 0.27-1.54).

          "content": "Water polo (WP) is a high-intensity team sport that requires a combination of physical endurance, muscular strength, speed, and specific technical skills. Due to the demanding and prolonged nature of this sport, adequate and balanced nutrition plays a fundamental role in athletes' performance, recovery, and overall health maintenance. We aimed to compile all available information on the importance of ergonutrition and supplementation in the recovery of WP players. This will help in understanding this sport's specific challenges and requirements, enabling players and coaches to design more effective recovery plans to optimize performance, achieve goals, and successfully cope with intense training and competition. English-language publications were searched in databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO Citation Index, Medline (PubMed), KCI Korean Journal Database, and Current Contents Connect using a series of keywords such as WP, nutrition, recovery, and ergogenic aids individually or in combination. In the field of ergonutritional recovery in WP, certain supplements such as whey protein, beta-alanine, L-arginine, spirulina, and copper can be beneficial for improving performance and recovery. In some cases, WP athletes may consider using ergogenic supplements to further improve their performance and recovery process. However, it is important to bear in mind that any supplement should be carefully evaluated under the supervision of a health professional or a sports nutritionist, as some supplements may present side effects or unwanted interactions. Adequate ergogenic nutrition adapted to the needs of WP players is essential not only to optimize their athletic performance but also to ensure effective recovery and maintain their long-term health and general well-being. The application of these strategies should be evidence-based and tailored to the individual needs of the players and the specific demands of the sport. Future experimental research that can confirm our results is essential.",

          "content": "Warfighters, often called tactical athletes, seek dietary supplementation to enhance training and recovery. Roughly 69% of active-duty US military personnel have reported consuming dietary supplements. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the impact of dietary supplements on muscle-related physical performance and recovery in active-duty military personnel. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental controlled trials of oral dietary supplementation in active-duty military members were examined. A protocol was registered (PROSPERO CRD42023401472), and a systematic search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was undertaken. Inclusion criteria consisted of studies published between 1990-2023 with outcomes of muscle performance and recovery among active-duty military populations. The risk of bias was assessed with the McMaster University Guidelines and Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies. Sixteen studies were included. Four were conducted on protein or carbohydrate; four on beta-alanine alone, creatine alone, or in combination; two on mixed nutritional supplements; two on probiotics alone or in combination with beta hydroxy-beta methylbutyrate calcium; and four on phytonutrient extracts including oregano, beetroot juice, quercetin, and resveratrol. Ten examined outcomes related to physical performance, and six on outcomes of injury or recovery. Overall, protein, carbohydrate, beta-alanine, creatine, and beetroot juice modestly improved performance, while quercetin did not. Protein, carbohydrates, beta-alanine, probiotics, and oregano reduced markers of inflammation, while resveratrol did not. Nutrition supplementation may have small benefits on muscle performance and recovery in warfighters. However, there are significant limitations in interpretation due to the largely inconsistent evidence of ingredients and comparable outcomes. Thus, there is inadequate practical evidence to suggest how dietary supplementation may affect field performance.",

          "content": "Beta-alanine is a nonessential amino acid that is commonly used to improve exercise performance. It could influence the buffering of hydrogen ions produced during intense exercise and delay fatigue, providing a substrate for increased synthesis of intramuscular carnosine. This systematic review evaluates the effects of beta-alanine supplementation on maximal intensity exercise in trained, young, male individuals. Six databases were searched on August 10, 2023, to identify randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effect of chronic beta-alanine supplementation in trained male individuals with an age range of 18-40\u00a0years. Studies evaluating exercise performance through maximal or supramaximal intensity efforts falling within the 0.5-10\u00a0min duration were included. A total of 18 individual studies were analyzed, employing 18 exercise test protocols and 15 outcome measures in 331 participants. A significant (p = .01) result was observed with an overall effect size of 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.09, 0.69]), in favor of beta-alanine supplementation versus placebo. Results indicate significant effects at 4\u00a0weeks of supplementation, effect size 0.34 (95% CI [0.02, 0.67], p = .04); 4-10\u00a0min of maximal effort, effect size 0.55 (95% CI [0.07, 1.04], p = .03); and a high beta-alanine dosage of 5.6-6.4\u00a0g per day, effect size 0.35 (95% CI [0.09, 0.62], p = .009). The results provide insights into which exercise modality will benefit the most, and which dosage protocols and durations stand to provide the greatest ergogenic effects. This may be used to inform further research, and professional or recreational training design, and optimization of supplementation strategies.",

A random-effects model and the standardized mean differences (SMD) \u00b1 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. The results showed that caffeine helped to improve jumping performance, isometric strength values, and the number of repetitions until failure. Caffeine and sodium phosphate helped to improve sprint performance. Aerobic tests could be improved with the use of taurine, caffeine, and beta-alanine. No conclusive effects of beetroot juice, polyphenols, or creatine in improving aerobic performance were shown. In terms of anaerobic variables, both caffeine and sodium phosphate could help to improve repeated sprint ability. More studies are needed in female athletes that measure the effects of different EAs on sports performance, such as beetroot juice, beta-alanine or sodium phosphate, as the studies to date are scarce and there are many types of EA that need to be further considered in this population, such as creatine and taurine.",

Therefore, \u03b2-alanine could be considered a nutritional ergogenic aid to improve sports performance in combat athletes. We aimed to critically review clinical trial evidence on the impact of \u03b2-alanine supplementation on sports performance, perception, and anthropometric parameters, as well as circulating biochemical markers in combat athletes. This systematic review was conducted following the specific methodological guidelines of the Preferred Report Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA), the PICOS question model, the Critical Review Form of McMaster, and the PEDro scale. Furthermore, the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool was used. The search was carried out in the SCOPUS, Web of Science (WOS), and Medline (PubMed) databases for studies published from the beginning of the database until July 31, 2023. Of the 41 registers identified, only 7 met the established criteria and were included in this systematic review. Overall, performance parameters related to strength, power, total exercise work capacity, and combat-specific parameters were significantly improved ( < 0.05). Perception parameters increased non-significantly ( > 0.05). Regarding biochemical parameters, carnosine increased significantly ( < 0.05), pH decreased non-significantly ( > 0.05), and the results for blood bicarbonate and blood lactate were heterogeneous. Finally, there was a non-significant ( > 0.05) improvement in the anthropometric parameters of lean mass and fat mass. \u03b2-alanine supplementation appears to be safe and could be a suitable nutritional ergogenic aid for combat athletes.",

          "content": "Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation increases muscle carnosine, an abundant endogenous antioxidant and pH buffer in skeletal muscle. Carnosine loading promotes exercise capacity in healthy older adults. As patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suffer from elevated exercise-induced muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress and acidosis, and from reduced muscle carnosine stores, it was investigated whether BA supplementation augments muscle carnosine and induces beneficial changes in exercise capacity, quadriceps function, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress in patients with COPD. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo (PL)-controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02770417), 40 patients (75% male) with COPD (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation: age 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0years; FEV % predicted 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014%) were assigned to 12\u00a0weeks oral BA or PL supplementation (3.2\u00a0g/day). The primary outcome, i.e. muscle carnosine, was quantified from m. vastus lateralis biopsies obtained before and after intervention. Co-primary outcomes, i.e. incremental and constant work rate cycle capacity, were also assessed. Linear mixed model analyses were performed. Compliance with and side effects of supplement intake and secondary outcomes (quadriceps strength and endurance, and muscle oxidative/carbonyl stress) were also assessed. Beta-alanine supplementation increased muscle carnosine in comparison with PL in patients with COPD (mean difference [95% confidence interval]; +2.82 [1.49-4.14] mmol/kg wet weight; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Maximal incremental cycling capacity (VO peak: +0.5 [-0.7 to 1.7] mL/kg/min; P\u00a0=\u00a00.384, Wpeak: +5 [-1 to 11] W; P\u00a0=\u00a00.103) and time to exhaustion on the constant work rate cycle test (+28 [-179 to 236] s; P\u00a0=\u00a00.782) did not change significantly. Compliance with supplement intake was similar in BA (median (quartile 1-quartile 3); 100 (98-100)%) and PL (98 (96-100)%) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.294) groups, and patients did not report side effects possibly related to supplement intake. No change was observed in secondary outcomes. Beta-alanine supplementation is efficacious in augmenting muscle carnosine (+54% from mean baseline value) without side effects\u00a0in patients with COPD in comparison with PL.

          "content": "Exercise intolerance is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and, although multifactorial, it is largely caused by lower-limb muscle dysfunction. Research has shown that patients with severe to very severe COPD have significantly lower levels of muscle carnosine, which acts as a pH buffer and antioxidant. Beta-alanine (BA) supplementation has been shown to consistently elevate muscle carnosine in a variety of populations and may therefore improve exercise tolerance and lower-limb muscle function. The primary objective of the current studies is to assess the beneficial effects of BA supplementation in enhancing exercise tolerance on top of two types of exercise training (non-linear periodised exercise (NLPE) training or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)) in patients with COPD. Two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have been designed. Patients will routinely receive either NLPE (BASE-TRAIN trial) or NMES (BASE-ELECTRIC trial) as part of standard exercise-based care during their 8-to-10 week pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme. A total of 222 patients with COPD (2\u00d777 = 154 patients in the BASE-TRAIN trial and 2\u00d734 = 68 patients in the BASE-ELECTRIC trial) will be recruited from two specialised PR centres in The Netherlands. For study purposes, patients will receive 3.2 g of oral BA supplementation or placebo per day. Exercise tolerance is the primary outcome, which will be assessed using the endurance shuttle walk test (BASE-TRAIN) or the constant work rate cycle test (BASE-ELECTRIC). Furthermore, quadriceps muscle strength and endurance, cognitive function, carnosine levels (in muscle), BA levels (in blood and muscle), markers of oxidative stress and inflammation (in blood, muscles and lungs), physical activity and quality of life will be measured. Both trials were approved by CMO Regio Arnhem-Nijmegen, The Netherlands (NL70781.091.19. and NL68757.091.19). NTR8427 (BASE-TRAIN) and NTR8419 (BASE-ELECTRIC).",

          "content": "Brisola, GMP and Zagatto, AM. Ergogenic effects of \u03b2-alanine supplementation on different sports modalities: strong evidence or only incipient findings? J Strength Cond Res 33(1): 253-282, 2019-\u03b2-Alanine supplementation is a popular nutritional ergogenic aid among the sports community. Due to its efficacy, already proven in the literature, to increase the intramuscular carnosine content (\u03b2-alanyl-L-histidine), whose main function is intramuscular buffering, \u03b2-alanine supplementation has become a nutritional strategy to improve performance, mainly in high-intensity efforts. However, although many studies present evidence of the efficacy of \u03b2-alanine supplementation in high-intensity efforts, discrepancies in outcomes are still present and the performance enhancing effects seem to be related to the specificities of each sport discipline, making it difficult for athletes/coaches to interpret the efficacy of \u03b2-alanine supplementation. Thus, this study carried out a review of the literature on this topic and summarized, analyzed, and critically discussed the findings with the objective of clarifying the current evidence found in the literature on different types of efforts and sport modalities. The present review revealed that inconsistencies are still found in aerobic parameters determined in incremental tests, except for physical working capacity at the neuromuscular fatigue threshold. Inconsistencies are also found for strength exercises and intermittent high-intensity efforts, whereas in supramaximal continuous mode intermittent exercise, the beneficial evidence is strong. In sports modalities, the evidence should be analyzed separately for each sporting modality. Thus, sports modalities that have strong evidence of the ergogenic effects of \u03b2-alanine supplementation are: cycling race of 4 km, rowing race of 2,000 m, swimming race of 100 and 200 m, combat modalities, and water polo. Finally, there is some evidence of slight additional effects on physical performance from cosupplementation with sodium bicarbonate.",

          "title": "Oral nutritional supplement fortified with beta-alanine improves physical working capacity in older adults: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.",
          "content": "This study examined the effects of an oral nutritional supplement fortified with two different doses of beta-alanine on body composition, muscle function and physical capacity in older adults. Using a double-blind placebo controlled design, 60 men and women (age \u00b1 SD = 70.7 \u00b1 6.2 yrs) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 1) oral nutritional supplement (ONS; n = 20) (8 oz; 230 kcal; 12 g PRO; 31 g CHO; 6 g FAT), 2) ONS plus 800 mg beta-alanine (ONS800; n = 19), and 3) ONS plus 1200 mg beta-alanine (ONS1200; n = 21). Treatments were consumed twice per day for 12 weeks. At pre- and post-supplementation period, participants performed a discontinuous, submaximal cycle ergometry test to determine physical working capacity at fatigue threshold (PWCFT). Fat mass, total body and arm lean soft tissue mass (ALSTM) were measured with DEXA while muscle strength was assessed with handgrip dynamometry (GRIP) and 30-s sit-to-stand (STS) was used to measure lower body functionality. Muscle quality (MQ) was calculated with GRIPmax and DEXA derived ALSTM [GRIP (kg)\u00b7ALSTM (kg)(-1)]. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare pre- to post-supplementation measures and group differences. There were 16 dropouts over the duration of the study. Final group sizes were ONS = 16 (m = 11, w = 5), ONS800 = 15 (m = 5, w = 10), and ONS1200 = 13 (m = 6, w = 7). No significant changes were observed for body composition or GRIP values pre to post. Significant increases in PW(CFT) were seen in ONS1200 (13.6%) and ONS800 (17.8%) pre- to post-supplementation (p < 0.05). These changes were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the changes in ONS (-6.3%). ONS1200 and ONS had significant increases in STS (22.2 and 10.7%, respectively). While ONS significantly increased in STS, no differences (p > 0.05) in change scores were found between ONS and ONS800. ONS fortified with beta-alanine may improve physical working capacity, muscle quality and function in older men and women. These findings could have importance in the perception of frailty, and the maintenance of health and independent living in older adults.",

A search strategy was developed in accordance with the standards for the reporting of scientific literature via systematic reviews. Five databases were thoroughly searched from inception to November 2012. Inclusion criteria were English language, human studies, used BA to increase exercise or athletic performance, systematic reviews or randomized controlled trials and were published in a peer-reviewed journal. Included studies were systematically graded for their methodological quality by rotating pairs of reviewers and the results were qualitatively synthesized. One systematic review and 19 randomized trials were included in this review. There is one systematic review with several methodological weaknesses that limit the confidence in its results. There are moderate to high quality studies that appear to support that BA may increase power output and working capacity, decrease the feeling of fatigue and exhaustion, and have of positive effect on body composition and carnosine content. The reporting of side effects from BA supplementation in the athletic population was generally under-reported. There appears to be some evidence from this review that supplementation with BA may increase athletic performance. However, there is insufficient evidence examining the safety of BA supplementation and its side effects. It is therefore recommended to err on the side of caution in using BA as an ergogenic aid until there is sufficient evidence confirming its safety.",

          "content": "Beta-alanine, caffeine, and nitrate are dietary supplements generally recognized by the sport and exercise science community as evidence-based ergogenic performance aids. Evidence supporting the efficacy of these supplements, however, is greatly skewed due to research being conducted primarily in men. The physiological differences between men and women, most notably in sex hormones and menstrual cycle fluctuations, make generalizing male data to the female athlete inappropriate, and potentially harmful to women. This narrative review outlines the studies conducted in women regarding the efficacy of beta-alanine, caffeine, and nitrate supplementation for performance enhancement. Only nine studies on beta-alanine, 15 on caffeine, and 10 on nitrate in healthy women under the age of 40\u00a0years conducted in normoxia conditions were identified as relevant to this research question. Evidence suggests that beta-alanine may lower the rate of perceived exertion and extend training bouts in women, leading to greater functional adaptations. Studies of caffeine in women suggest the physiological responder status and caffeine habituation may contribute to caffeine's efficacy, with a potential plateau in the dose-response relationship of performance enhancement. Nitrate appears to vary in influence based on activity type and primary muscle group examined. However, the results summarized in the limited literature for each of these three supplements provide no consensus on dosage, timing, or efficacy for women. Furthermore, the literature lacks considerations for hormonal status and its role in metabolism. This gap in sex-based knowledge necessitates further research on these ergogenic supplements in women with greater considerations for the effects of hormonal status.",

Resting muscle biopsies of the m. vastus lateralis were taken at 0, 12 and 24 weeks and analysed for taurine content (BA, N\u2009=\u200912; PL, N\u2009=\u20096) using high-performance liquid chromatography. Resting venous blood samples were taken every 4\u00a0weeks and analysed for markers of renal, hepatic and muscle function (BA, N\u2009=\u200915; PL, N\u2009=\u20098; aspartate transaminase; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; lactate dehydrogenase; albumin; globulin; creatinine; estimated glomerular filtration rate and creatine kinase). There was a significant main effect of group (p\u2009=\u20090.04) on muscle taurine, with overall lower values in PL, although there was no main effect of time or interaction effect (both p\u2009>\u20090.05) and no differences between specific timepoints (week 0, BA: 33.67\u2009\u00b1\u20098.18 mmol\u00a0kg\u00a0dm, PL: 27.75\u2009\u00b1\u20094.86 mmol\u00a0kg\u00a0dm; week 12, BA: 35.93\u2009\u00b1\u20098.79 mmol\u00a0kg\u00a0dm, PL: 27.67\u2009\u00b1\u20094.75 mmol\u00a0kg\u00a0dm; week 24, BA: 35.42\u2009\u00b1\u20096.16 mmol\u00a0kg\u00a0dm, PL: 31.99\u2009\u00b1\u20095.60 mmol\u00a0kg\u00a0dm).

          "title": "International society of sports nutrition position stand: nutrition and weight cut strategies for mixed martial arts and other combat sports.",
          "content": "Following an extensive literature review, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) has developed an official position on nutritional and weight cut strategies for combat sports. The type of combat sport, length of the fight camp, and time between weigh-in and competition are factors influencing nutritional and weight cut strategies. The following 16 points constitute the Position Statement of the Society; the Research Committee has approved them. 1. Combat sports have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and competition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and weight cut strategies for training and competition. 2. As the duration of a combat match increases, >4 min, contribution of the aerobic system can rise to\u2009>70%, yet anaerobic alactic pathways and anaerobic glycolytic pathways support high-output bursts. 3. During the off camp/general preparation phase, athletes should maintain a weight ranging 12% to 15% above the weight division requirement. 4. Supplements including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance performance and/or recovery during preparation phases, competition, and post-competition. 5. During fight camp, strategic decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an efficient longitudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be determined using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such as Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham. 6. Protein should be prioritized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean body mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports training demands. Macronutrients should not drop below the following: carbohydrates 3.0-4.0\u2009g/kg, protein 1.2-2.0\u2009g/kg, and fat 0.5 to 1.0\u2009g/kg/day. 7. Suitable losses in body mass range from 6.7% at 72\u00a0h, 5.7% at 48\u00a0h, and 4.4% at 24\u00a0h, prior to weigh-in. 8. Sodium restriction and water loading are effective for inducing polyuria and acute water loss. 9. During fight week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through exercise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1% to 2% loss in body mass, with equivalent losses from a low-fiber intake of <10\u2009g/day for 4\u2009days. 10. During fight week, acute water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immersion, and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate supervision (optimally ~2-4% of body mass within 24\u00a0h of weigh-in). 11. Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are utilized to recover lost body fluid/mass before competition with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage. 12. Oral rehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with a sodium range of 50-90\u2009mmol/dL should take precedence immediately post-weigh-in. 13. Fast-acting carbohydrates at a tolerable rate of\u2009\u2264\u200960 g/h should follow oral rehydration solutions. Post weigh-in intake of fiber should be limited to avoid gastrointestinal distress. 14. Post-weigh-in carbohydrate intake at 8-12\u2009g/kg may be appropriate for combat athletes that undertook significant glycogen depletion strategies during fight week. About 4-7\u2009g/kg may be suitable for modest carbohydrate restriction. 15. Post weigh-in, rehydration/refueling protocols should aim to regain\u2009\u226510% of body mass to mitigate declines in performance and the negative effects of rapid weight loss. 16. The long-term effects of frequent weight cuts on health and performance are unknown, necessitating further research.",

Omega-3 fatty acids, \u03b2-alanine, and carnosine are among the many nutrients that contribute to immune system health. For space flight, crewmembers are prescribed a diet with a macronutrient composition of 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15% protein. To quantify omega-3 fatty acid, \u03b2-alanine and carnosine intakes from such a diet, and to examine each nutrient's impact on exercise performance, 21 participants adhered to the aforementioned macronutrient ratio for 14 days which was immediately followed by a workout performed on gravity-independent resistive exercise hardware. Results included daily omega-3 fatty acid intakes below the suggested dietary intake. Daily omega-3 fatty acid, \u03b2-alanine and carnosine intakes each correlated with non-significant amounts of variance from the workout's volume of work. Given the nutritional requirements to maintain immune system function and the demands of in-flight exercise countermeasures for missions of increasingly longer durations current results, in combination with previously published works, imply in-flight supplementation may be a prudent approach to help address the physiological and mental challenges incurred by astronauts on future space flights.",

          "content": "Athletes are increasingly exploring ways to enhance their physical performance. Increasing blood flow to the working tissues through endothelium-dependent vasodilation is one factor athletes use to realize these results. Sports supplements such as pre-workouts tout this benefit; however, many have not been tested under laboratory conditions to examine the effects of commonly used supplements on vasodilation. Two popular supplements are Nitrosigine\u00ae and citrulline malate (CM). Thus, the purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of Nitrosigine and CM on vasodilation using ultrasound and flow mediated dilation (FMD). Healthy, normotensive, and physically active male (n\u2009=\u200916) and female (n\u2009=\u20098) young adults participated in the present investigation. We utilized a randomized, double-blind, within-subjects design where participants reported for three trials, each preceded by a 7-day washout period. Baseline FMD measurement was obtained for each visit, followed by consumption of one clinical dose CM (8\u2009g), Nitrosigine (1.5\u2009g), or dextrose placebo (8\u2009g). Following a 60-min digestion period, FMD was repeated. Supplementation order was randomized controlling for potential order effects. Repeated measures ANOVA yielded a significant supplement (3) x time (2) effect (p\u2009<\u2009.001), such that Nitrosigine and CM yielded a greater improvement in FMD response than placebo. After supplementation, Nitrosigine and CM increased FMD by 31 and 34%, respectively, compared to a decrease of 2% during the placebo trial. After allometric scaling of the FMD values, supplement x time effect remained significant (p\u2009=\u2009.001) and changes were similar to non-scaled results. Nitrosigine (23%) and CM (25%) generated significantly greater allometric scaled FMD values when compared to the placebo trial (0.60%). Both Nitrisigine and CM increased endothelial-dependent vasodilation as measured by a change in FMD. Increased vasodilation leads to an increase in skeletal muscle blood flow resulting in potential improvements in exercise performance.",

          "content": "Citrulline malate (CitMal) is a dietary supplement that is suggested to enhance strength training performance. However, there is conflicting evidence on this matter. Thus, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine whether supplementing with CitMal prior to strength training could increase the total number of repetitions performed before reaching voluntary muscular failure. A systematic search was conducted wherein the inclusion criteria were double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in healthy participants that examined the effect of CitMal on repetitions to failure during upper body and lower body resistance exercises. The Hedges's g standardized mean differences (SMD) between the placebo and CitMal trials were calculated and used in a random effect model. Two separate subanalyses were performed for upper body and lower body exercises. Eight studies, including 137 participants who consisted of strength-trained men (n = 101) and women (n = 26) in addition to untrained men (n = 9), fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Across the studies, 14 single-joint and multijoint exercises were performed with an average of 51 \u00b1 23 total repetitions during 5 \u00b1 3 sets per exercise at \u223c70% of one-repetition maximum. Supplementing with 6-8 g of CitMal 40-60\u00a0min before exercise increased repetitions by 3 \u00b1 5 (6.4 \u00b1 7.9%) compared with placebo (p = .022) with a small SMD (0.196). The subanalysis for the lower body resulted in a tendency for an effect of the supplement (8.1 \u00b1 8.4%, SMD: 0.27, p = .051) with no significant effect for the upper body (5.7 \u00b1 8.4%, SMD: 0.16, p = .131). The current analysis observed a small ergogenic effect of CitMal compared with placebo. Acute CitMal supplementation may, therefore, delay fatigue and enhance muscle endurance during high-intensity strength training.",

          "title": "Dietary Arginine and Citrulline Supplements for Cardiovascular Health and Athletic Performance: A Narrative Review.",
          "content": "The global market for nutritional supplements (NS) is growing rapidly, and the use of L-arginine (Arg), L-citrulline (Cit), and citrulline malate (CitMal) supplements has been shown to enhance cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Over the past decade, Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements have received considerable attention from researchers in the field of exercise nutrition, who have investigated their potential effects on hemodynamic function, endothelial function, aerobic and anaerobic capacity, strength, power, and endurance. Previous studies were reviewed to determine the potential impact of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and exercise performance. By synthesizing the existing literature, the study aimed to provide insight into the possible uses and limitations of these supplements for these purposes. The results showed that both recreational and trained athletes did not see improved physical performance or increased nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with 0.075 g or 6 g doses of Arg supplement per body weight. However, 2.4 to 6 g of Cit per day for 7 to 16 days of various NSs had a positive impact, increasing NO synthesis, enhancing athletic performance indicators, and reducing feelings of exertion. The effects of an 8 g acute dose of CitMal supplement were inconsistent, and more research is needed to determine its impact on muscle endurance performance. Based on the positive effects reported in previous studies, further testing is warranted in various populations that may benefit from nutritional supplements, including aerobic and anaerobic athletes, resistance-trained individuals, elderly people, and clinical populations, to determine the impact of different doses, timing of ingestion, and long-term and acute effects of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and athletic performance.",

          "content": "Physical activity and nutrition play important roles in preventing adverse health outcomes that accompany aging. It has been shown that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) combined with citrulline (CIT) supplementation can improve physical and functional capacities. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum metabolites following a 12-week HIIT combined or not with CIT in obese older adults, and to correlate the metabolic changes with clinico-biological parameters changes. Eighty-six obese older adults completed a 12-week HIIT program combined with a 10\u2005g daily supplementation of either CIT or placebo (PLA) during a double-blinded randomized interventional trial. Only participants with blood samples at T0 (before the intervention) and/or T12 (after the intervention) were included in our sub-analysis (HIIT-PLA-T0: n\u2009=\u200944 and HIIT-PLA-T12: n\u2009=\u200928; HIIT-CIT-T0: n\u2009=\u200939 and HIIT-CIT-T12: n\u2009=\u200942). Serum samples were analyzed by different liquid or gas phase chromatography methods coupled to mass spectrometry. Among the identified metabolites, 44 changed significantly following the 12-week intervention (Time effect), and 10 of them were more affected when HIIT was combined with CIT (Time\u2009Supp effect). Arginine increased significantly due to the 12-week intervention. Correlation analyses demonstrated that decreased triglyceride (TG) (16:1/18:1/16:0) and aspartic acid significantly correlated with a reduction of adiposity-related parameters (fat mass, leg lean mass, leptin, total triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein). Arginine, TG (16:1/18:1/16:0) and aspartic acid might constitute biomarkers of cardiometabolic health and adiposity. Further studies are needed to confirm these associations and understand the underlying mechanisms. A 12-week intervention involving high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with or without citrulline (CIT) supplementation induced adaptations in the serum metabolome of obese older adults through significant changes in 44 metabolites.Changes in 23 metabolites were observed when a CIT supplementation was administered along with a 12-week HIIT intervention.TG (16:1/18:1/16:0) correlated with several adiposity parameters including leptin, triglycerides, legs lean mass.Aspartic acid correlated with several adiposity parameters including leptin, LDL cholesterol as well as android, arms and trunk fat mass.",

          "content": "The decline in cognitive performance has been shown after fatiguing exercise. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been suggested to alleviate exercise-induced central fatigue. Arginine and citrulline could remove the excess NH3 accumulation accompanied with BCAA supplementation by increasing nitric oxide biosynthesis and/or urea cycle. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the combined supplementation of BCAA, arginine, and citrulline on central fatigue after three simulated matches in well-trained taekwondo athletes. In a double-blind randomized cross-over design, 12 male taekwondo athletes performed two trials containing three simulated matches each. Each match contained three 2-min rounds of high-intensity intermittent exercise. At the end of the second match, two different supplementations were consumed. In the AA trial, the subjects ingested 0.17\u00a0g/kg BCAA, 0.05\u00a0g/kg arginine and 0.05\u00a0g/kg citrulline, while placebo was consumed in the PL trial. A validated taekwondo-specific reaction test battery was used to measure the cognitive performance after each match. The premotor reaction time in the three single-task tests and the reaction time in the secondary task in the dual-task test were maintained in the AA trial after three matches, while they were impaired in the PL trial, resulting in significantly better performance in the AA trial. These improvements in the AA trial coincided with significantly lower plasma free tryptophan/BCAA ratio, increased NOx concentrations, and similar NH3 concentrations. This study suggested that the combined supplementation could alleviate the exercise-induced central fatigue in elite athletes.",

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05778266), 44 adolescents (15-19 years) with MASLD and obesity were assigned to HIIT + L-cit (n = 14), HIIT + placebo (n = 14), or L-cit (n = 15) for 12 weeks. HIIT sessions (85% and 60% peak heart rate during intense and recovery periods) occurred thrice weekly. Training volume progressively increased, and participants performed 20 min of HITT per session in the last 8 weeks. Outcomes included pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (Aix75), VO2peak, body composition, BP, glucose and lipid profiles, and hepatic steatosis. Compared to L-cit, HIIT + L-cit improved non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( = 0.04), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( = 0.01), triglycerides ( = 0.02), and VO2peak ( = 0.001). No significant between-group changes were found in PWV, AIx75, hepatic steatosis, and body composition. HIIT + placebo improved VO2peak ( = 0.002), and L-cit decreased the degree of steatosis ( = 0.038). HIIT + L-cit supplementation enhanced lipid profile and cardiorespiratory fitness, while HIIT + placebo improved cardiorespiratory capacity, and L-cit alone decreased hepatic steatosis. Thus, L-cit could be an adjuvant strategy to manage obesity-related MASLD in adolescents.",

Our study aimed to explore whether serum levels of amino acids related to urea cycle, i.e., arginine, citrulline, and ornithine, are also associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in T2DM. We extracted medical records of 1032 consecutive patients with T2DM from the Electronic Administrative System of Liaoning Medical University First Affiliated Hospital (LMUFAH) system from May 2015 to August 2016. Of them, 855 patients with completed data available were used in the analysis. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m. Serum amino acids were measured by mass spectrometry (MS) technology. Binary logistic regression was performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 52.3% of the 855 T2DM patients were male, and 143 had CKD. In univariable analysis, high serum citrulline, high ratio of arginine to ornithine, and low ratio of ornithine to citrulline were associated with markedly increased risk of CKD (OR of top vs. bottom tertile: 2.87, 95%CI, 1.79-4.62 & 1.98, 95%CI,1.25-3.14 & 2.56, 95%CI, 1.61-4.07, respectively).

Preoperative and 1-year postoperative assessments included citrulline, I-FABP, glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and C peptide levels. Significant weight loss and T2DM remission (11/21) were observed post-SG. Preoperatively, patients had low citrulline and high I-FABP levels, which normalized postoperatively. A positive correlation was found between the I-FABP/citrulline ratio and weight, BMI, glucose, insulin, and C peptide levels. SG not only induces enterocyte dysfunction and mass recovery but also may facilitate T2DM remission and alleviate obesity-related effects on the enteroendocrine system.

The role of PADI-citrullinome in immune response in cancer has not been evaluated. We hypothesized that PADI-mediated citrullinome is a source of neoantigens in cancer that induces immune response. Protein expression of PADI family members was evaluated in 196 cancer cell lines by means of indepth proteomic profiling. Gene expression was assessed using messenger RNA data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Immunohistochemical analysis of PADI2 and peptidyl-citrulline was performed using breast cancer tissue sections. Citrullinated 12-34-mer peptides in the putative Major Histocompatibility Complex-II (MHC-II) binding range were profiled in breast cancer cell lines to investigate the relationship between protein citrullination and antigen presentation. We further evaluated immunoglobulin-bound citrullinome by mass spectrometry using 156 patients with breast cancer and 113 cancer-free controls. Proteomic and gene expression analyses revealed PADI2 to be highly expressed in several cancer types including breast cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis of 422 breast tumor tissues revealed increased expression of PADI2 in ER- tumors (p<0.0001); PADI2 protein expression was positively correlated (p<0.0001) with peptidyl-citrulline staining. PADI2 expression exhibited strong positive correlations with a B cell immune signature and with MHC-II-bound citrullinated peptides. Increased circulating citrullinated antigen-antibody complexes occurred among newly diagnosed breast cancer cases relative to controls (p=0.0012). An immune response associated with citrullinome is a rich source of neoantigens in breast cancer with a potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

          "content": "Citrulline is a popular dietary supplement, primarily thought to exert ergogenic effects on exercise performance through the enhancement of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and ammonia buffering. However, recent findings surrounding citrulline's effect on endurance performance have been inconsistent. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature have yet to be undertaken. To determine if acute ingestion of citrulline has an ergogenic effect on endurance performance in young healthy adults. A systematic search of three databases was undertaken to find peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English investigating the effects of citrulline supplementation on endurance performance in young healthy adults. Two independent investigators completed a three-phased screening procedure against pre-determined eligibility criteria. Included studies evaluated loading or bolus dosage regimes of citrulline in participants aged 18 or over that were at least recreationally active. Outcome measures focused on time-to-completion (TTC) or time-to-exhaustion (TTE) in continuous submaximal intensity exercise. Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed-effects model to pool the weighted estimate of standardized mean differences (SMD) across studies. A chi-squared test assessed heterogeneity between studies. This review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Nine studies (\u2009=\u2009158 participants) met the eligibility criteria; five reported TTE outcomes (I\u2009=\u20090%, \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.37, df\u2009=\u20094, \u2009=\u20090.99) and four reported TTC outcomes (I\u2009=\u20090%, \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.46, df\u2009=\u20093, \u2009=\u20090.93), both with a low between-study heterogeneity. The results of the meta-analyses showed no significant difference in the endurance performance measures, TTE (pooled SMD\u2009=\u20090.03 [-0.27, 0.33]) and TTC (pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.07 [-0.50, 0.15]), after acute ingestion of citrulline supplementation or a control in young healthy adults. The current evidence suggests no significant benefit of citrulline supplementation for endurance performance. However, the small evidence base requires further research to fully evaluate this topic. Recommendations include a focus on female populations; higher continuous doses of citrulline over seven days; and TTC outcome measures over longer distances to simulate competition.",

Data analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4.1 software, employing a random effects model to statistically analyze the pooled effect sizes of the obtained systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) data. Results are reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). A total of 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of l-citrulline supplementation and watermelon intake on BP in middle-aged and elderly individuals were included, comprising 24 datasets involving 415 participants. The results indicate that l-citrulline supplementation and watermelon intake significantly reduced SBP (-4.02 mmHg [95 % CI: -6.54 to -1.50], P = 0.002) and DBP (-2.54 mmHg [95 % CI: -4.27 to -0.81], P = 0.004) in the elderly. Subgroup analysis showed that the combined supplementation of l-citrulline and l-arginine significantly decreased SBP (-10.44 mmHg [95 % CI: -13.57 to -7.31], P < 0.00001) and DBP (-4.86 mmHg [95 % CI: -7.93 to -1.79], P = 0.002) in this population. l-citrulline supplementation and watermelon intake overall lowered BP in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Subgroup analysis indicates that the combined supplementation of l-citrulline and l-arginine is superior to l-citrulline or watermelon supplementation alone. These findings provide new dietary recommendations for BP management in the elderly, suggesting that dietary interventions can effectively improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).",

However, CM exhibited a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure in several metrics: delta 24\u2009h (-14\u2009mmHg vs -6\u2009mmHg, \u2009=\u20090.047), delta wakefulness (-12\u2009mmHg vs -4\u2009mmHg, \u2009=\u20090.024), percent delta 24\u2009h (-16% vs -6%, \u2009=\u20090.024), and percent delta wakefulness (-14% vs -4%, \u2009=\u20090.013). No significant differences were found between CM and PLA in terms of systolic and diastolic nocturnal absolute reductions (-13\u2009mmHg vs -12\u2009mmHg, \u2009=\u20090.808, and -13\u2009mmHg vs -8\u2009mmHg, \u2009=\u20090.273, respectively) or nocturnal percentage decrease (-9.9% vs -9.4%, \u2009=\u20090.844, and -15.3% vs -11.7%, \u2009=\u20090.399, respectively). The study found no significant changes in the post-exercise nocturnal blood pressure dip following a single dose of CM supplementation. However, a notable reduction in diastolic blood pressure was observed during the waking period and over the average 24-h monitoring period. ClinicalTrials.gov platform (NCT03378596).",

          "content": "Elevated serum ferritin has been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and adverse health outcomes in subjects with the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). As the mechanisms underlying the negative impact of excess iron have so far remained elusive, we aimed to identify potential links between iron homeostasis and metabolic pathways. In a cross-sectional study, data were obtained from 163 patients, allocated to one of three groups: (1) lean, healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a053), (2) MetS without hyperferritinemia (n\u00a0=\u00a054) and (3) MetS with hyperferritinemia (n\u00a0=\u00a056). An additional phlebotomy study included 29 patients with biopsy-proven iron overload before and after iron removal. A detailed clinical and biochemical characterization was obtained and metabolomic profiling was performed via a targeted metabolomics approach. Subjects with MetS and elevated ferritin had higher fasting glucose (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), HbA1c (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035) and 1\u00a0h glucose in oral glucose tolerance test (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) compared to MetS subjects without iron overload, whereas other clinical and biochemical features of the MetS were not different. The metabolomic study revealed significant differences between MetS with high and low ferritin in the serum concentrations of sarcosine, citrulline and particularly long-chain phosphatidylcholines. Methionine, glutamate, and long-chain phosphatidylcholines were significantly different before and after phlebotomy (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for all metabolites). Our data suggest that high serum ferritin concentrations are linked to impaired glucose homeostasis in subjects with the MetS. Iron excess is associated to distinct changes in the serum concentrations of phosphatidylcholine subsets. A pathway involving sarcosine and citrulline also may be involved in iron-induced impairment of glucose metabolism.",

J Strength Cond Res 36(12): 3562-3570, 2022-This systematic review examines the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation (SUP) on muscle strength and hypertrophy when combined with physical exercise. The databases PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE were searched for full-text articles published between January 2000 and June 2020. For inclusion, studies had to report on the effects of SUP administered as acute or chronic doses together with a standardized exercise protocol on muscle strength and hypertrophy compared with placebo in healthy adults who were sedentary, physically active, or professional athletes. Twelve studies (1,571 subjects) were finally selected. In 5 studies, the SUP regime was acute, and in 7, it was chronic. SUP was nitrate-rich beetroot juice in 9 studies, a potassium nitrate capsule in 1, and increased dietary nitrate in 2. Ingested nitrate was 64-1,200 mg. Of the 12 studies, 6 observed an ergogenic effect of SUP compared with placebo. These findings indicate that muscle strength gains are possible provided the dose, format, frequency, period, and exercise test are appropriate. Best results were observed with a minimum acute dose of 400 mg of nitrate provided as beetroot juice/shot taken 2-2.5 hours before exercise involving low- and high-intensity muscle contractions. This SUP regime seems to improve muscle efficiency in terms of reduced phosphocreatine and energy costs (P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and improved time to exhaustion.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the influence of dietary nitrate supplementation on performance metrics during cycling sprint exercise according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted on MEDLINE, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases up to September 2023. Inclusion criteria were healthy recreationally active men and women who consumed nitrate-rich and nitrate-deficient beetroot juice to assess performance outcomes of mean power, peak power, time-to-peak power, and minimum power during 30-s cycling sprints. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 and TESTEX tools and funnel plots. A random effects model was performed on six studies and showed that dietary nitrate had significant effects on time-to-peak power (SMD: -0.66, 95% CI: -1.127 to -0.192,  = 0.006) but not on mean power, peak power, or minimum power. Subgroup analysis revealed that an acute low nitrate dose improved time-to-peak power (SMD: -0.977, 95% CI: -1.524 to -0.430,  < 0.001) but not after a multiday moderate nitrate dose (SMD: -0.177, 95% CI: -0.619 to -0.264,  = 0.431). These data suggest that acute nitrate supplementation can benefit time-to-peak power during 30-s cycling sprints, but due to the limited availability of data and heterogeneity in methodology, these results should be interpreted with caution. There was insufficient data on women to analyze sex-based differences. Future studies are required to provide insight on how supplementation regimen and population impact the effects of dietary nitrate for enhancing cycling sprint performance.",

          "content": "Dietary nitrate supplementation can enhance exercise performance in healthy people, but it is not clear if it is beneficial in COPD. We investigated the hypotheses that acute nitrate dosing would improve exercise performance and reduce the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise in people with COPD. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over single dose study. Subjects were randomised to consume either nitrate-rich beetroot juice (containing 12.9 mmoles nitrate) or placebo (nitrate-depleted beetroot juice) 3 hours prior to endurance cycle ergometry, performed at 70% of maximal workload assessed by a prior incremental exercise test. After a minimum washout period of 7 days the protocol was repeated with the crossover beverage. 21 subjects successfully completed the study (age 68 \u00b1 7 years; BMI 25.2 \u00b1 5.5 kg/m2; FEV1 percentage predicted 50.1 \u00b1 21.6%; peak VO2 18.0 \u00b1 5.9 ml/min/kg). Resting diastolic blood pressure fell significantly with nitrate supplementation compared to placebo (-7 \u00b1 8 mmHg nitrate vs. -1 \u00b1 8 mmHg placebo; p = 0.008). Median endurance time did not differ significantly; nitrate 5.65 (3.90-10.40) minutes vs. placebo 6.40 (4.01-9.67) minutes (p = 0.50). However, isotime oxygen consumption (VO2) was lower following nitrate supplementation (16.6 \u00b1 6.0 ml/min/kg nitrate vs. 17.2 \u00b1 6.0 ml/min/kg placebo; p = 0.043), and consequently nitrate supplementation caused a significant lowering of the amplitude of the VO2-percentage isotime curve. Acute administration of oral nitrate did not enhance endurance exercise performance; however the observation that beetroot juice caused reduced oxygen consumption at isotime suggests that further investigation of this treatment approach is warranted, perhaps targeting a more hypoxic phenotype.

          "content": "Menopause is linked to reduced estrogen and nitric oxide (NO) production, which may contribute to declines in muscle function and quality of life. Acute dietary nitrate intake from beetroot has been shown to improve NO bioavailability and muscle function in older. However, the effects of prolonged dietary nitrate supplementation (i.e., longer than two weeks) remain unexplored. This study investigated the effects of four and eight weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation on muscle contractile properties and nitrate tolerance in postmenopausal women. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel study. Participants received daily 20\u00a0g of nitrate-rich beetroot extract (BET, containing \u223c548\u00a0mg/8.8\u00a0mmol nitrate) or nitrate-depleted beetroot extract (PLA, containing \u223c43\u00a0mg/0.7\u00a0mmol nitrate) for eight weeks. Outcomes, including circulating nitrate and nitrite levels and muscle contractile properties, were assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 8. Twenty-two participants completed the study. Fasting nitrate and nitrite levels were significantly higher in the BET group than in the PLA group-nitrate at week 4 and both nitrate and nitrite at week 8. At week 8, maximal knee extensor torque (F) was significantly greater in the BET group compared to PLA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), while no changes were seen for maximal power (P) or velocity (V). Peak torque and power improved at week 8, especially at angular velocities of 60\u00b0\u00b7s and 90\u00b0\u00b7s for torque, and at 90\u00b0\u00b7s, 180\u00b0\u00b7s, and 270\u00b0\u00b7s for power. This study demonstrated that eight weeks of nitrate-rich beetroot extract increases fasting nitrate and nitrite levels, enhancing muscle strength and power in postmenopausal women.",

          "content": "The purpose of this review was to examine the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance by systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled human studies. A search of four electronic databases and cross-referencing found 17 studies investigating the effect of inorganic nitrate supplementation on exercise performance that met the inclusion criteria. Beetroot juice and sodium nitrate were the most common supplements, with doses ranging from 300 to 600 mg nitrate and prescribed in a manner ranging from a single bolus to 15 days of regular ingestion. Pooled analysis showed a significant moderate benefit (ES = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.23-1.35) of nitrate supplementation on performance for time to exhaustion tests (p = .006). There was a small but insignificant beneficial effect on performance for time trials (ES = 0.11, 95% CI: -0.16-0.37) and graded exercise tests (ES = 0.26, 95% CI: -0.10-0.62). Qualitative analysis suggested that performance benefits are more often observed in inactive to recreationally active individuals and when a chronic loading of nitrate over several days is undertaken. Overall, these results suggest that nitrate supplementation is associated with a moderate improvement in constant load time to exhaustion tasks. Despite not reaching statistical significance, the small positive effect on time trial or graded exercise performance may be meaningful in an elite sport context. More data are required to clarify the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance and to elucidate the optimal way to implement supplementation.",

          "content": "Oral inorganic nitrate (NO) supplementation has been shown to increase bioavailable NO and provide potential ergogenic benefits in males; however, data in females is scarce. Estrogen is known to increase endogenous NO bioavailability and to fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle (MC), being lowest in the early follicular (EF) phase and highest during the late follicular (LF) phase. This study examined the effects of oral NO supplementation on exercise economy, endurance capacity, and vascular health in young females across the MC. Ten normally menstruating females' MCs were tested in a double-blinded, randomized design during both the EF and LF phases of the MC. Participants consumed \u223c13 mmol NO, in the form of 140 mL beetroot juice (BRJ) or an identical NO-depleted placebo (PL) for \u223c3 days before lab visits and 2 h before testing on lab visits. Plasma nitrate, nitrite, and estradiol were assessed, as was blood pressure and pulse wave velocity. Moderate-intensity exercise economy and severe intensity time to exhaustion (TTE) were tested on a cycle ergometer. As expected, plasma estradiol was elevated in the LF phase, and plasma nitrite and nitrate were elevated in the BRJ condition. Exercise economy was unaltered by BRJ or the MC, however TTE was significantly worsened by 48 s (\u223c10%) after BRJ supplementation ( = 0.04), but was not different across the MC with no interaction effects. In conclusion, NO supplementation did not affect exercise economy or vascular health and worsened aerobic endurance capacity (TTE), suggesting healthy females should proceed with caution when considering supplementation with BRJ. Although inorganic nitrate (NO) supplementation has increased in popularity as a means of improving exercise performance, data in females at different phases of the menstrual cycle are lacking despite known interactions of estrogen with NO. This study revealed neither NO supplementation nor the menstrual cycle influenced exercise economy or vascular health in healthy young naturally menstruating females, while NO supplementation significantly worsened endurance capacity (10%) independent of the menstrual cycle phase.",

          "content": "Dietary nitrate supplementation has been shown to decrease the oxygen cost of exercise and prolong exercise tolerance, as measured by sub-maximal exercise endurance distance and time at 85% V\u0307O2max, in both elite athletes and normal healthy subjects. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have reduced quality of life and ability to perform activities of daily living attributable to diminished exercise tolerance, and dietary nitrate may be able to ameliorate this. We performed a double-blind, computer-randomized placebo control crossover trial at a tertiary Australian hospital to investigate whether dietary nitrate supplementation as beetroot juice (BR) would augment submaximal exercise endurance in individuals with spirometrically confirmed stable moderate COPD. Volunteers underwent an incremental shuttle walk test to determine V\u0307O2max followed by a test dose of BR to establish safety in the study population. Participants performed an endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) at 85% V\u0307O2max after randomization to either a 3 day wash-in of BR (4.8 mmol twice a day) or placebo (nitrate deplete BR), with a final dose on the morning of testing. They then crossed over after 4 day washout. Repeated measures two sided paired t-tests were employed. 35 participants were recruited with 19 completing the trial. In the initial safety phase, we measured systolic blood pressure over four hours post first dose of BR, and found a mean 10 mmHg decrement maximal at 1 hour. One individual developed symptomatic postural hypotension and was excluded. The primary outcomes of ESWT distance and time to fatigue improved by 11% and 6% respectively; however these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.494 and 0.693 respectively).

          "content": "Cold exposure increases blood pressure (BP) and salivary flow rate (SFR). Increased cold-induced SFR would be hypothesized to enhance oral nitrate delivery for reduction to nitrite by oral anaerobes and to subsequently elevate plasma [nitrite] and nitric oxide bioavailability. We tested the hypothesis that dietary nitrate supplementation would increase plasma [nitrite] and lower BP to a greater extent in cool compared with normothermic conditions. Twelve males attended the laboratory on four occasions. Baseline measurements were completed at 28\u00b0C. Subsequently, participants ingested 140 mL of concentrated nitrate-rich (BR; \u223c13 mmol nitrate) or nitrate-depleted (PL) beetroot juice. Measurements were repeated over 3 h at either 28\u00b0C (Norm) or 20\u00b0C (Cool). Mean skin temperature was lowered compared with baseline in PL-Cool and BR-Cool. SFR was greater in BR-Norm, PL-Cool, and BR-Cool than PL-Norm. Plasma [nitrite] at 3 h was higher in BR-Cool (592\u2009\u00b1\u2009239 nM) versus BR-Norm (410\u2009\u00b1\u2009195 nM). Systolic BP (SBP) at 3 h was not different between PL-Norm (117\u2009\u00b1\u20096 mmHg) and BR-Norm (113\u2009\u00b1\u20099 mmHg). SBP increased above baseline at 1, 2, and 3 h in PL-Cool but not BR-Cool. These results suggest that BR consumption is more effective at increasing plasma [nitrite] in cool compared with normothermic conditions and blunts the rise in BP following acute cool air exposure, which might have implications for attenuating the increased cardiovascular strain in the cold. Compared with normothermic conditions, acute nitrate ingestion increased plasma [nitrite], a substrate for oxygen-independent nitric oxide generation, to a greater extent during cool air exposure. Systolic blood pressure was increased during cool air exposure in the placebo condition with this cool-induced blood pressure increase attenuated after acute nitrate ingestion. These findings improve our understanding of environmental factors that influence nitrate metabolism and the efficacy of nitrate supplementation to lower blood pressure.",

          "content": "To identify how variables such as exercise condition, supplementation strategy, participant characteristics and demographics, and practices that control oral microbiota diversity could modify the effect of inorganic nitrate ingestion (as nitrate salt supplements, beetroot juice, and nitrate-rich vegetables) on exercise performance, we conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis. Studies were identified in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of inorganic nitrate on exercise performance in healthy adults. To assess the variation in effect size, we used meta-regression models for continuous variables and subgroup analysis for categorical variables. A total of 123 studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising 1705 participants. Nitrate was effective for improving exercise performance (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.101; 95% CI: 0.051, 0.151, P\u00a0<0.001, I2\u00a0=\u00a00%), although nitrate salts supplementation was not as effective (P\u00a0=\u00a00.629) as ingestion via beetroot juice (P\u00a0<0.001) or a high-nitrate diet (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Practices that control oral microbiota diversity influenced the nitrate effect, with practices harmful to oral bacteria decreasing the ergogenic effect of nitrate. The ingestion of nitrate was most effective for exercise lasting between 2 and 10 min\u00a0(P\u00a0<0.001). An inverse dose-response relation between the fraction of inspired oxygen and the effect size (coefficient: -0.045, 95% CI: -0.085, -0.005, P\u00a0=\u00a00.028) suggests that nitrate was more effective in increasingly hypoxic conditions. There was a dose-response relation for acute administration (P\u00a0=\u00a00.049). The most effective acute dose was between 5 and 14.9 mmol\u00a0provided \u2265150 min\u00a0prior to exercise (P\u00a0<0.001). An inverse dose-response for protocols\u00a0\u22652 d was observed (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025), with the optimal dose between 5 and 9.9 mmol\u00b7d-1 (P\u00a0<0.001). Nitrate, via beetroot juice or a high-nitrate diet, improved exercise performance, in particular, in sessions lasting between 2 and 10 min.\u00a0Ingestion of 5-14.9 mmol\u22c5d-1 taken \u2265150 min\u00a0prior to exercise appears optimal for performance gains and athletes should be aware that practices controlling oral microbiota diversity may decrease the effect of nitrate.",

Searches were conducted on MEDLINE, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and SPORTDiscus databases up to April 2023. Inclusion criteria were adult resistance-trained males who supplemented with a nitrate-rich supplement and nitrate-deficient placebo to assess repetitions-to-failure (RTF), peak power, mean power, peak velocity, and/or mean velocity during back squat and bench press exercise. A random effects model was performed on six studies and showed that nitrate supplementation improved RTF (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.43, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 0.156 to 0.699,  = 0.002), mean power (SMD: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.127 to 0.678,  = 0.004), and mean velocity (SMD: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.07 to 1.061,  = 0.025) but had no effect on peak power (SMD: 0.204, 95% CI: -0.004 to 0.411,  = 0.054) or peak velocity (SMD: 0.00, 95% CI: -0.173 to 0.173,  = 1.000) when back squat and bench press were combined. Subgroup analyses revealed that back squats were more likely to be enhanced and that a dosing regimen may influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation. Overall, nitrate supplementation had a small beneficial effect on some aspects of resistance exercise performance, but there were limited studies available and the variability was large. Additional studies that focus on upper and lower body resistance exercise and nitrate dosage are required to elucidate the efficacy of dietary nitrate supplementation on resistance exercise performance.",

J Strength Cond Res 32(6): 1796-1808, 2018-The purpose of this article was to systematically review the current literature and evaluate the overall efficacy of nitrate supplementation on exercise tolerance and performance by meta-analysis. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) were an experimental trial published in an English peer-reviewed journal; (b) compared the effects of inorganic nitrate consumption with a non-bioactive supplement control or placebo; (c) used a quantifiable measure of exercise performance; and (d) was carried out in apparently healthy participants without disease. A total of 29 studies were identified that investigated the effects of nitrate supplementation on exercise tolerance or performance in accordance with the criteria outlined. Analysis using time to exhaustion as the outcome variable revealed a significant effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise tolerance (ES = 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.47; p = 0.006) compared with placebo. Analysis using time to complete a specific distance as the outcome variable revealed no significant effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance (ES = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.28 to 0.17; p = 0.64) compared with placebo. Nitrate supplementation is likely to improve exercise tolerance and capacity that may improve exercise performance. More research is required to determine the optimal dose and duration of nitrate supplementation. It would also be important to consider the type of athlete performing the exercise and the duration, intensity, and mode of the exercise performed because these factors are likely to influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation.",

Therefore, the present double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the effects of [Formula: see text] supplementation on isokinetic peak power, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) force, muscular endurance (time-to-task failure; TTF), and recovery from fatigue in young females ( = 12) and males ( = 14). Participants consumed \u223c13 mmol [Formula: see text] [beetroot juice (BRJ)], or an identical [Formula: see text]-depleted beverage placebo (PL), for \u223c3 days and 2 h before testing visits. Plasma nitrate and nitrite were elevated in the BRJ condition ( \u2264 0.05). Peak power (W\u00b7kg) showed a sex effect ( \u2264 0.05) at all angular velocities and a sex-by-treatment effect at 270 and 360\u00b0/s ( \u2264 0.05). Post hoc analysis revealed no significant differences between treatments ( > 0.05). Estimated maximal knee extension power () and maximal knee extension velocity () demonstrated no sex, treatment, or sex-by-treatment effect ( > 0.05). There were no significant effects for TTF (F: PL; 269\u2009\u00b1\u2009161 vs. BRJ; 277\u2009\u00b1\u2009158 s and M: PL; 228\u2009\u00b1\u2009171 vs. BRJ; 194\u2009\u00b1\u2009100 s;  > 0.05). Cohen's  effect sizes for peak power showed moderate to large effect sizes at 270 ( = 0.92) and 360\u00b0/s ( = 0.81), showing a possible differentiated effect of dietary nitrate in females and males. The present data indicate that [Formula: see text] supplementation does not significantly affect knee extensor maximal power, maximal contraction velocity, and muscular endurance in either sex. The sex-dependent response to dietary nitrate supplementation requires further investigation as data on females is scarce. Recent data have suggested that inorganic nitrate ([Formula: see text]) supplementation may benefit males; however, females may experience worsened endurance capacity. This study revealed a potential differentiated effect of [Formula: see text] supplementation on outcomes of muscle contractile function between healthy, young males and females. The specific responses of [Formula: see text] supplementation in females and across sexes remain understudied and require further investigation.",

Estrogen increases NO bioavailability and fluctuates throughout the menstrual cycle, with low levels in the early follicular (EF) phase and peaking during the late follicular (LF) phase. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of [Formula: see text] supplementation on isokinetic peak power, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) force, muscular endurance, and recovery from fatigue in healthy young females during the EF and LF phases of the menstrual cycle. Ten eumenorrheic females were tested in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled design.

Plasma estradiol was elevated in the LF phase, and plasma nitrite and nitrate were elevated in the BRJ condition ( < 0.05). Although isokinetic peak power was unchanged, calculated maximal power (Pmax) and maximal velocity (Vmax) were significantly worsened in the BRJ treatment independent of the menstrual cycle phase ( = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). Muscular endurance, MVIC, and fatigue recovery were unaltered by BRJ or the menstrual cycle. These data indicate that [Formula: see text] supplementation decreased maximal power and velocity in females and suggest that the benefits of [Formula: see text] supplementation previously found in males may not extend to young females. Recent data have suggested that inorganic nitrate ([Formula: see text]) supplementation may benefit males, however, females may experience worsened endurance capacity independent of menstrual cycle phase. This study revealed neither [Formula: see text] supplementation nor the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle influenced maximal isometric voluntary contraction or endurance capacity in healthy, young, naturally menstruating females, whereas [Formula: see text] supplementation significantly worsened estimated peak power (Pmax) and velocity (Vmax) independent of the menstrual cycle phase.",

          "content": "Previous clinical studies have shown controversial results regarding the effect of inorganic nitrate supplementation on blood pressure (BP) in older individuals. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of inorganic nitrate on BP in older adults. Eligible studies were searched in Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase. Randomized controlled trials which evaluated the effect of inorganic nitrate consumption on BP in older adults were recruited. The random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled effect sizes. 22 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, inorganic nitrate consumption significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) by -3.90\u00a0mmHg (95% confidence interval: -5.23 to -2.57; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by -2.62\u00a0mmHg (95% confidence interval: -3.86 to -1.37; P\u00a0<\u00a00.005) comparing with the control group. Subgroup analysis showed that the BP was significantly reduced when participants' age\u226565, BMI>30, or baseline BP in prehypertension stage. And both SBP and DBP decreased significantly after acute nitrate supplementation of a single dose (<1 day) or more than 1-week. However, participants with hypertension at baseline were not associated with significant changes in both SBP and DBP. Subgroup analysis of measurement methods showed that only the resting BP group showed a significant reduction in SBP and DBP, compared with the 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) group and daily home BP measurement group. These results demonstrate that consuming inorganic nitrate can significantly reduce SBP and DBP in older adults, especially in whose age\u00a0\u2265\u00a065, BMI\uff1e30, or baseline BP in prehypertension stage.",

          "content": "Perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate are widely recognized as endocrine disrupting chemicals, which are closely related to thyroid function. Animal and human studies show a correlation between thyroid hormone and bone mineral density (BMD). However, it remains unknown whether perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate were associated with BMD. This study aimed to explore the association between perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate exposure with BMD. A cross-sectional analysis among 5607 participants from the 2011-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was conducted in the present study. Perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate were detected in urine by ion chromatography. Survey-weighted generalized linear regression, restricted cubic splines, and qgcomp models were used to assess the association of BMDs with single and mixed perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate exposures. In addition, age, gender, and BMI stratified these associations. Negative associations were found between perchlorate and nitrate with BMDs. Furthermore, based on the qgcomp model results, the combined association of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate exposure was negatively associated with BMDs (\u03b2 = -0.017, 95% CI: -0.041, -0.024 for total BMD; \u03b2 = -0.017, 95% CI: -0.029, -0.005 for lumbar BMD). Additionally, there was a significant effect after gender, age, and BMI stratification between perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate with BMDs in the normal weight group (\u03b2 = -0.015, 95% CI: -0.020, -0.011 for total BMD; \u03b2 = -0.022, 95% CI: -0.028, -0.016 for lumbar BMD) and children and adolescents group (\u03b2 = -0.025, 95% CI: -0.031, -0.019 for total BMD; \u03b2 -0.017, 95% CI: -0.029, -0.005 for lumbar BMD). The present study indicated a negative correlation between BMDs and urinary perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate levels, with nitrate being the main contributor to the mixture effect. People with normal weight and children and adolescents were more likely to be affected.",

          "content": "Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, is currently widely used in athletes to increase muscle mass and strength and has also been used as a nutritional supplement in recent years to maintain muscle mass in muscular atrophic diseases of older people. However, the effects of HMB supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function in older people remain controversial. The purpose of this review was to explore the effects of HMB on body composition in older adults. The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to obtain the randomized controlled trials needed as a basis for systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of 9 studies (448 participants) were eventually found eligible. The pooled results showed that HMB supplementation significantly increased fat-free mass in older people compared with the control group (effect size: 0.37; 95% Cl 0.16, 0.58; Z value\u2009=\u20093.47, P\u2009=\u20090.001; Fixed-effect model).

Subgroup analysis of HMB supplementation alone showed a significant improvement in fat-free mass in older people (effect size: 0.59; 95% CI 0.32, 0.87; Z\u2009=\u20094.24, P\u2009<\u20090.001; fixed-effect model), whereas HMB supplementation combined with exercise intervention showed no additional fat-free mass change (effect size: 0.06; 95% CI -\u00a00.26, 0.38; Z\u2009=\u20090.38, P\u2009=\u20090.705; Fixed-effect model). HMB supplementation is beneficial for improving body composition in older people. However, the effect of HMB supplementation combined with exercise therapy to improve muscle mass is not obvious.

          "content": "Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a popular supplement in the resistance training community, with its use supported by claims of increased strength, muscle growth, and improved recovery; however, research outcomes are variable. Therefore, we meta-analyzed the effectiveness of HMB on strength, body composition, and muscle damage. Nine qualifying studies yielded 14 comparisons subcategorized by training experience (trained, untrained) to provide 12-13 estimates of strength (upper body, lower body, overall average), 13 estimates of fat and fat-free mass, and 7 estimates of the muscle-damage marker creatine kinase. The meta-analysis comprised 394 subjects (age 23 +/- 2 years, mean +/- between-study SD) with 5 +/- 2 weeks' intervention and 5 +/- 6 h.wk of training. The estimates were analyzed using a meta-analytic mixed model with study sample size as the weighting factor that included the main-effect covariates to control for between-study differences in HMB dose, intervention duration, training load, and dietary cointervention. To interpret magnitudes, meta-analyzed effects were standardized using the composite baseline between-subject SD and were qualified using modified Cohen effect size thresholds. There were small benefits to lower-body (mean +/- 90% confidence limit: 9.9% +/- 5.9%) and average strength (6.6 +/- 5.7%), but only negligible gains for upper-body strength (2.1 +/- 5.5%) were observed in untrained lifters. In trained lifters, all strength outcomes were trivial. Combined (all studies), the overall average strength increase was trivial (3.7 +/- 2.4%), although uncertainty allows for a small benefit. Effects on fat and fat-free mass were trivial, and results regarding creatine kinase were unclear. Supplementation with HMB during resistance training incurs small but clear overall and leg strength gains in previously untrained men, but effects in trained lifters are trivial. The HMB effect on body composition is inconsequential. An explanation for strength gains in previously untrained lifters requires further research.",

          "content": "Growing evidence suggests beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate's (HMB) positive effects on recovery following exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). However, findings vary substantially across studies. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to assess the effects of HMB supplementation on recovery following EIMD by assessing indirect markers of muscle damage, namely creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels among healthy participants. A comprehensive search was performed on electronic databases (Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar) up to October 2017 for trials evaluating the effects of HMB on recovery following EIMD. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation of follow-up CK and LDH concentrations were extracted to calculate the effect size for meta-analysis. A total of 324 participants for CK and 229 participants for LDH were found from the 10 and 8 studies, respectively. The results revealed a significant effect of HMB supplementation on CK (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -60.71 UL; 95% confidence interval [CI], -78.12 to -43.29; I = 4.1%; p = 0.40) and LDH reduction (WMD = -15.42 UL; 95% CI, -22.2 to -8.6; I = 0.0%; p = 0.53). In addition, a subgroup analysis based on study duration (< 6\u00a0weeks vs. \u2265 6\u00a0weeks) suggested that HMB effectiveness on EIMD was statistically significant in studies over 6\u00a0weeks (p < 0.001). The current evidence revealed a time-dependent effect of HMB in reducing LDH and CK serum levels among adults. HMB, therefore, may be seen as a priority muscle damage recovery agent in interventions.",

J Strength Cond Res 38(4): e202-e210, 2024-\u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) has been used extensively as a dietary supplement for athletes and physically active people. However, the ergogenic effect of HMB supplementation on endurance performance is still unclear. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) aimed to assess HMB supplementation on endurance performance and V\u0307O 2 max . This SRMA followed PRISMA guidelines. Three electronic databases were searched (PubMed/Medline, Web of Science [WOS], and Scopus) from inception until April 3, 2023. In this SRMA, human experimental trials, controlled with a placebo group, assessing the effect of HMB supplementation on endurance performance in a healthy population were included. The quality of the studies was assessed by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The study protocol was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Review (PROSPERO): CRD42022341790. Eleven studies involving 279 participants met the inclusion criteria. The results displayed a significant improvement on endurance performance (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.58 [0.28-0.87]) and V\u0307O 2 max (pooled SMD = 0.58 [0.21-0.95]) after HMB ingestion. Moreover, after the exclusion of the studies not evenly distributed around the base of the funnel plot, the results continued to be significantly positive in endurance performance (pooled SMD = 0.38 [0.22-0.53]) and V\u0307O 2 max (pooled SMD = 0.25 [0.09-0.42]). In conclusion, HMB (3 g\u00b7d -1 ) ingestion during 2-12 weeks significantly improves endurance performance and V\u0307O 2 max .",

          "content": "\u03b2-Hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB), a leucine metabolite, can increase skeletal muscle size and function. However, HMB may be less effective at improving muscle function in people with insufficient Vitamin D3 (25-OH-D < 30 ng/mL) which is common in middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that combining HMB plus Vitamin D3 (HMB + D) supplementation would improve skeletal muscle size, composition, and function in middle-aged women. In a double-blinded fashion, women (53 \u00b1 1 yrs, 26 \u00b1 1 kg/m2, n = 43) were randomized to take placebo or HMB + D (3 g Calcium HMB + 2000 IU D per day) during 12 weeks of sedentary behavior (SED) or resistance exercise training (RET). On average, participants entered the study Vitamin D3 insufficient while HMB + D increased 25-OH-D to sufficient levels after 8 and 12 weeks. In SED, HMB + D prevented the loss of arm lean mass observed with placebo. HMB + D increased muscle volume and decreased intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) volume in the thigh compared to placebo but did not change muscle function. In RET, 12-weeks of HMB + D decreased IMAT compared to placebo but did not influence the increase in skeletal muscle volume or function. In summary, HMB + D decreased IMAT independent of exercise status and may prevent the loss or increase muscle size in a small cohort of sedentary middle-aged women. These results lend support to conduct a longer duration study with greater sample size to determine the validity of the observed positive effects of HMB + D on IMAT and skeletal muscle in a small cohort of middle-aged women.",

          "content": "Supplementation of high protein oral nutrition shakes supplemented with \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HP-HMB) has been shown to improve muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in older adults, but the roles of HP-HMB supplementation on the intramuscular adiposity remained unknown. This 12-week randomized controlled trial evaluated the changes of muscle mass, muscle strength, physical performance and intramuscular adiposity among community-dwelling pre-frail older persons. This was an open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trail that enrolled 70 community-dwelling pre-frail older persons without active or uncontrolled conditions, disability or dementia. The intervention group was provided with two services of HP HMB (Ensure\u00ae Plus Advance containing 3g HMB) per day for 12 weeks, and the control group was provided with professional nutritional counselling for sufficient protein intake. All participants received functional assessments, laboratory tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the dominant leg before and after study. Intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and the mid-thigh cross-sectional area (CSA) of muscle were obtained by MRI, and the IMAT-to-CSA ratio was calculated to evaluate intramuscular adiposity. Overall, 62 participants (mean age: 71.1\u00b13.8 years, 69.4% female) completed the study (HP-HMB group: 29, control group: 33) and comparisons of baseline characteristics between groups were not statistically different. For the primary outcome, HP-HMB group showed significant improvements in the CSA of mid-thigh muscle (mean increase of CSA: 149.1\u00b1272.3 for HMB group vs -22.9\u00b1309.1 mm2 for control group, P=0.045). The improvement of MNA-SF was borderline (0.28\u00b10.75 vs. -0.15\u00b10.94, P=0.064), but serum levels of Vit D were significantly increased in the HMB group (3.83\u00b18.18 vs. -1.30\u00b14.81 ng/mL, P=0.002). Moreover, the body weight and BMI were significantly increased in the HMB group (1.10\u00b11.18 vs. 0.24\u00b11.13 kg, P=0.005; 0.56\u00b10.68 vs. 0.22\u00b10.47 kg/m2, P=0.019). In particular, the IMAT-to-CSA ratio was reduced in the HMB group (-0.38\u00b11.21 vs. -0.02\u00b12.56 %, P=0.06). Using the generalized estimating equation, we found that SPPB score in chair rise test was significantly improved (\u03b2=0.71, 95% C.I.0.09-1.33, P=0.026). The 12-week supplementation with high protein oral nutrition shake supplemented with 3g HMB per day significantly increased muscle mass, as well as nutritional status and physical performance, and ameliorated the intramuscular adiposity of pre-frail older persons. Further study is needed to explore the long-term benefits of HP-HMB supplementation on muscle and metabolic health for older adults.",

However, there is very little evidence on the true benefits of combining both strategies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantify the effects of exercise in addition to HMB supplementation, on physical and cognitive health in older adults. Data from 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of HMB supplementation and physical function in adults aged 50 years or older were analyzed, involving 384 participants. Results showed that HMB supplementation in addition to physical exercise has no or fairly low impact in improving body composition, muscle strength, or physical performance in adults aged 50 to 80 years, compared to exercise alone. There is a gap of knowledge on the beneficial effects of HMB combined with exercise to preserve cognitive functions in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Future RCTs are needed to refine treatment choices combining HMB and exercises for older people in particular populations, ages, and health status. Specifically, interventions in older adults aged 80 years or older, with cognitive impairment, frailty, or limited mobility are required.",

          "content": "The world's over-65 population is expanding rapidly, and the risk of malnutrition is prevalent in this population. Meeting nutritional needs is a recognized strategy to reduce and address multiple debilitating adverse health outcomes associated with malnutrition. The objective of this randomized, controlled trial was to determine the effects of oral nutritional supplement (ONS) containing beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), along with dietary counseling, on health outcomes in community-dwelling older adults at risk of malnutrition. Strengthening Health In ELDerly through nutrition (SHIELD) studied adults aged\u00a0\u2265\u00a065 years in Singapore who were recruited between August 2017 and March 2019. Participants were community ambulant and classified as medium or high risk for malnutrition using Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST). Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0811) were randomly assigned to one of two study treatments for 180 days: (i) two servings/day of ONS containing HMB with dietary counseling (n\u00a0=\u00a0405) or (ii) two servings/day of placebo supplement with dietary counseling (n\u00a0=\u00a0406). The primary composite outcome was 'survival without hospital (re)admission and with at least 5% weight gain to day 180'. Dietary intakes, nutritional and functional outcomes were measured at baseline, 30, 90, and 180 days. A higher proportion in intervention group met the 180-day primary composite outcome compared to placebo (33.4% vs. 8.7%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), largely driven by body weight component (36.2% vs. 9.4%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Survival and hospital (re)admission rate were not significantly different between the groups. Weight, BMI, and mid upper arm circumference were significantly greater in the intervention group compared to placebo during the study (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and at days 30, 90, and 180 (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The odds of having better nutritional status during the study were also significantly higher in the intervention group compared to placebo, as measured using MUST risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.68, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and vitamin D status (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.23, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Intervention group had significantly higher energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate intakes than the placebo group (all P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.017). Leg strength at day 90 was significantly greater for the intervention group than for the placebo group (LSM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE: 12.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22 vs. 12.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22; P\u00a0=\u00a00.030).

          "content": "Resistance training (RT) and nutritional supplementation seem to have beneficial effects on muscle properties and physical performance in older adults. However, the reported effects of specific RT programmes and supplementation prescriptions vary among studies. The present study aims to examine the acute and residual effects of RT and/or beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance in older women with reduced muscle mass. This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Older women fitting the eligibility criteria were recruited in February 2018 from a population-based sample identified via screening conducted in October 2017. In March 2018, 156 participants were randomly allocated to undergo one of four interventions (RT + HMB, RT + placebo, education + HMB and education + placebo) for 12 weeks. Supervised RT consisted of body weight, elastic band, ankle weight and machine-based exercises two times per week at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology (TMIG). Each participant ingested HMB (1200\u2009mg) or placebo supplements once daily. Sessions of education not associated with sarcopenia treatment were conducted every 2\u2009weeks. Post-intervention follow-up will be conducted for 12 weeks, until September 2018. The study includes assessments conducted in March (baseline), June (post-intervention) and September 2018 (follow-up). The primary outcome is the longitudinal change in muscle mass. Secondary outcomes include the longitudinal changes in muscle strength, physical performance, muscle thickness, muscle quality, blood counts, blood biochemistry, calf circumference, skin viscoelasticity, habitual dietary intake, habitual physical activity levels, functional capacity and health-related quality of life. Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the TMIG, Japan. The study is being conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The findings will be presented at international academic congresses and published in peer-reviewed international journals. UMIN000028560; Post-results.",

Cluster-randomized controlled trial. Seventy-two institutionalized older adults (age\u2009=\u200983\u2009\u00b1\u200910 years old; 63% women) were randomized in four groups: exercise plus placebo (EX), HMB supplementation, EX plus HMB supplementation (EX\u2009+\u2009HMB), and control (CT). The exercising participants completed a 12-week tailored multicomponent exercise intervention (Vivifrail; 5 days/week of an individualized resistance, cardiovascular, balance and flexibility program), whereas the HMB groups received a drink containing 3\u2009g/day of HMB. Participants were assessed Pre and Post intervention for disability and cognitive function (validated questionnaires), physical function (short physical performance battery, SPPB), handgrip strength and sit-to-stand relative muscle power. Linear mixed-effect models were used to compare changes among groups. Compared to baseline, both EX and EX\u2009+\u2009HMB improved cognitive function (+2.9 and +1.9 points; p\u2009<\u20090.001), SPPB score (+2.9 points and +2.4 points; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and relative muscle power (+0.64 and +0.48\u2009W\u00b7kg; p\u2009<\u20090.001), while CT and HMB remained unchanged (p\u2009>\u20090.05).

The Vivifrail exercise program was effective in improving cognitive and physical function, and muscle power in nursing home residents, while HMB supplementation did not provide additional benefits when combined with exercise. These results emphasize the importance of physical exercise interventions in very old people as an essential basis for improving their overall health and quality of life.",

Outcomes investigated were: total body mass (TBM), FFM, fat mass (FM), total single repetition maximum (1RM), bench press (BP) 1RM, and lower body (LwB) 1RM. Databases consulted were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (Embase), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SportDiscus. Fourteen studies fit the inclusion criteria; however, 11 were analyzed after data extraction and funnel plot analysis exclusion. A total of 302 participants (18-45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 248 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes. We conclude that HMB produces a small effect on TBM gain, but this effect does not translate into significantly greater increases in FFM, strength or decreases in FM during periods of RET. Our findings do not support the use of HMB aiming at improvement of body composition or strength with RET.",

Testing prior to, and immediately following, supplementation included a full blood count, plasma testosterone and cortisol, blood electrolytes, lipids, urea and glucose, sperm count and motility, and assessment of psychological state. A 3 x 2 factorial ANOVA revealed no effect of HMB or HMBCr on any of the measured parameters except minor changes in blood bicarbonate and blood monocyte and lymphocyte counts. Blood bicarbonate was significantly decreased in the HMB post-supplementation sample compared to the control and HMBCr groups. Blood monocyte and lymphocyte counts showed no within-group changes for HMB or HMBCr supplementation but were significantly different from the control.

          "content": "Frailty is a key element in healthy ageing in which muscle performance plays a main role. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation has shown favourable effects in modulating protein synthesis, improving muscle mass and function in interventional studies. Decreased age-related endogenous HMB levels have been shown in previous studies. The aim of the present study is to assess whether there is an association between endogenous plasma HMB levels and frailty. Data from 1290 subjects (56.98% women; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation age 74.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.95\u00a0years) from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging were obtained. Participants had their frailty status qualified according to Fried's Frailty Phenotype (FFP) score and the Frailty Trait Scale in its 12-domain version (FTS-12). Plasma HMB levels were analysed by an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Differences between groups (frail vs. non-frail) were tested using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-squared test. The association between HMB and frailty was assessed by multivariate linear and logistic regressions when frailty was analysed as continuous and binary, respectively. Models were adjusted by age, gender, comorbidity, body composition and protein intake. HMB levels were lower in those aged \u226575\u00a0years than in those aged 65-74\u00a0years, with an inverse linear relationship between age and HMB levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.031; P\u00a0=\u00a00.018), mainly accounted by males (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.062; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). HMB levels were higher in men (0.238\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.065 vs. 0.193\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.051\u00a0ng/mL; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). HMB levels were significantly lower in frail than in non-frail individuals: 0.204\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.058 versus 0.217\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.063\u00a0ng/dL (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) according to the FFP and 0.203\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.059 versus 0.219\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.063\u00a0ng/mL (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) according to FTS-12. These differences showed a dose-dependent profile when we compared them by quintiles of HMB (P for trend: 0.022; 0.012 and 0.0004, respectively, for FFP, FTS-12 binary and FTS-12 continuous). Variables associated with low HMB levels were body mass index, strength, exhaustion and weight loss. Frailty was associated with HMB levels in all the adjusted models, including the fully adjusted ones, no matter the tool used (odds ratio: 0.45 [0.26, 0.77] for FFP and 0.36 [0.20, 0.63] for FTS-12 binary; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-4.76 [-7.29, -2.23] for FTS-12 score). This association was also observed when the analyses were done by quintiles, showing such association since Q4 (FFP), Q2 (FTS-12 binary) and Q3 (FTS-12 score). The associations were observed in the whole sample and in each gender. There is an inverse association between HMB levels and frailty status. These findings support the design of targeted clinical trials to evaluate the effect of HMB supplementation in older frail people with low HMB levels.",

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-by-two factorial design trial was conducted at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology.

Participants attended supervised RT sessions twice weekly or education programs every 2 wk and were provided calcium-HMB (1500 mg) or placebo supplements once daily for 12 wk. The main outcomes were changes in functional MQ, assessed by knee extension strength per quadriceps thickness, and compositional MQ, assessed by the echo intensity of the rectus femoris muscle. Overall, 156 and 149 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments, respectively. Two-factorial analysis of variance showed no significant interaction of HMB supplementation with RT in terms of functional or compositional MQ. Main-effects analyses revealed that the decline in functional MQ of the group performing RT was smaller by 0.71 N\u00b7mm-1 (95% confidence interval, 0.11-1.31) compared with that in the education group. No significant main effects of RT or HMB supplementation on compositional MQ were observed. HMB supplementation did not enhance the treatment effects of RT for either MQ parameter; however, RT reduced the decline in functional MQ. Thus, adding HMB supplementation to RT is not significantly useful for improving MQ in this population.",

          "content": "Cancer cachexia causes significant morbidity and mortality in advanced lung cancer patients. Clinical benefit of \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate, arginine, and glutamine (HMB/Arg/Gln) was assessed in newly diagnosed patients. NOURISH, a prospective, two-arm, open-label, multi-centre, randomised controlled phase II trial compared cachexia in patients who received HMB/Arg/Gln with those who did not. All patients received structured nutritional, exercise and symptom control via a Macmillan Durham Cachexia Pack. Conducted in five UK centres, patients aged >\u200918\u2009years, with newly diagnosed advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who were able to take oral nutrition, with a performance status of 0-to-2 and a life expectancy >\u20094\u2009months were eligible for trial entry. Patients suitable for treatment with curative intent were ineligible. The trial was designed as a signal-seeking pilot study with target recruitment of 96 patients. One-to-one randomisation was stratified by diagnosis (SCLC or NSCLC), stage of disease (locally advanced or metastatic) and performance status. The primary outcome measure was treatment success defined as a patient being alive without significant loss of lean body mass (not >\u20095%) by 12\u2009weeks. Secondary outcome measures included quality of life. Between February-2012 and February-2013, 38 patients were recruited, 19 to each arm. Baseline characteristics were balanced. The trial was halted due to slow accrual and partial adherence. Trial data demonstrated no evidence of treatment benefit. No serious adverse events were reported during the trial. Further evaluation of HMB/Arg/Gln in this setting could not be recommended on the basis of this trial. ISRCTN registry: 39911673; 14-Apr-2011 https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN39911673 .",

          "content": "The decline in cognitive performance has been shown after fatiguing exercise. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been suggested to alleviate exercise-induced central fatigue. Arginine and citrulline could remove the excess NH3 accumulation accompanied with BCAA supplementation by increasing nitric oxide biosynthesis and/or urea cycle. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the combined supplementation of BCAA, arginine, and citrulline on central fatigue after three simulated matches in well-trained taekwondo athletes. In a double-blind randomized cross-over design, 12 male taekwondo athletes performed two trials containing three simulated matches each. Each match contained three 2-min rounds of high-intensity intermittent exercise. At the end of the second match, two different supplementations were consumed. In the AA trial, the subjects ingested 0.17\u00a0g/kg BCAA, 0.05\u00a0g/kg arginine and 0.05\u00a0g/kg citrulline, while placebo was consumed in the PL trial. A validated taekwondo-specific reaction test battery was used to measure the cognitive performance after each match. The premotor reaction time in the three single-task tests and the reaction time in the secondary task in the dual-task test were maintained in the AA trial after three matches, while they were impaired in the PL trial, resulting in significantly better performance in the AA trial. These improvements in the AA trial coincided with significantly lower plasma free tryptophan/BCAA ratio, increased NOx concentrations, and similar NH3 concentrations. This study suggested that the combined supplementation could alleviate the exercise-induced central fatigue in elite athletes.",

          "content": "There is marked heterogeneity in the response to weight loss interventions with regards to weight loss amount and metabolic improvement. We sought to identify biomarkers predictive of type 2 diabetes remission and amount of weight loss in individuals with severe obesity enrolled in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) and the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) studies. Targeted mass spectrometry-based profiling of 135 metabolites was performed in pre-intervention blood samples using a nested design for diabetes remission over five years (n\u2009=\u200993 LABS, n\u2009=\u200980 Look AHEAD; n\u2009=\u200987 remitters), and for extremes of weight loss at five years (n\u2009=\u2009151 LABS; n\u2009=\u200975 with high weight loss). Principal components analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, with PCA-derived metabolite factors tested for association with both diabetes remission and weight loss. Metabolic markers were tested for incremental improvement to clinical models, including the DiaRem score. Two metabolite factors were associated with diabetes remission: one primarily composed of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and tyrosine (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) [OR (95% CI)]\u2009=\u20091.4 [1.0-1.9], p\u2009=\u20090.045), and one with betaine and choline (OR [95% CI]\u2009=\u20090.7 [0.5-0.9], p\u2009=\u20090.02).These results were not significant after adjustment for multiple tests. Inclusion of these two factors in clinical models yielded modest improvements in model fit and performance: in a constructed clinical model, the C-statistic improved from 0.87 to 0.90 (p\u2009=\u20090.02), while the net reclassification index showed improvement in prediction compared to the DiaRem score (NRI\u2009=\u20090.26, p\u2009=\u20090.0013). No metabolite factors associated with weight loss at five years. Baseline levels of metabolites in the BCAA and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)-microbiome-related pathways are independently and incrementally associated with sustained diabetes remission after weight loss interventions in individuals with severe obesity. These metabolites could serve as clinically useful biomarkers to identify individuals who will benefit the most from weight loss interventions.",

Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2014-2018 were used. Overall, 4852 participants aged \u226565 years were included in the study. Demographic, lifestyle, and health data were obtained through interviews and questionnaires. The 24-h recall method was used to assess dietary intake. An amino acid database was established using the 9th revision of the Korean Standard Food Composition Table. The mean handgrip strength was estimated from triplicate measurements obtained using the dominant hand. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between BCAA intake and handgrip strength. Grains greatly contributed to amino acid intake; however, a significant negative association was observed between handgrip strength and increased BCAA intake through grains. In the fully adjusted model, leucine intake and handgrip strength showed a positive association. Thus, consuming BCAAs (especially leucine) via a variety of food sources can help maintain muscle health in older people.",

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of 16 weeks branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) supplementation on frailty in frail compensated cirrhotic patients. After a 4-week run-in period consisted of dietary and exercise counseling, compensated cirrhotic patients with frailty, defined by liver frailty index (LFI)\u22654.5, were randomly assigned (1:1) to BCAA or control group. The BCAA group received twice daily BCAAs supplementation (210\u00a0kcal, protein 13.5\u00a0g, BCAA 2.03\u00a0g) for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was frailty reversion. The secondary outcomes were changes in biochemistries, body composition evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and quality of life (QoL). 54 patients were prospectively enrolled (age 65.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.9 years, 51.9% female, Child-Pugh A/B 68.5%/31.5%, MELD 10.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1).

The proportion of frailty reversion at week 16 was significantly higher in BCAA group (36% vs. 0%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Compared with baseline, BCAA group had a significant increase in skeletal muscle index (7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 to 7.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u00a0kg/m, P\u2009=\u20090.03). Regarding the QoL, only the BCAA group had a significant improvement in all 4 domains of physical component score of the SF-36 questionnaire.

Their association with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has become a focal point of scientific debate, with emerging evidence suggesting both beneficial and detrimental roles. This review aims to dissect the multifaceted relationship between BCAAs and cardiovascular health, exploring the molecular mechanisms and clinical implications. Elevated BCAA levels have also been linked to insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), inflammation, and dyslipidemia, which are well-established risk factors for CVD. Central to these processes are key pathways such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activate B cells (NF-\u03baB)-mediated inflammation, and oxidative stress. Additionally, the interplay between BCAA metabolism and gut microbiota, particularly the production of metabolites like trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), adds another layer of complexity. Contrarily, some studies propose that BCAAs may have cardioprotective effects under certain conditions, contributing to muscle maintenance and metabolic health. This review critically evaluates the evidence, addressing the biological basis and signal transduction mechanism, and also discusses the potential for BCAAs to act as biomarkers versus active mediators of cardiovascular pathology. By presenting a balanced analysis, this review seeks to clarify the contentious roles of BCAAs in CVD, providing a foundation for future research and therapeutic strategies required because of the rising prevalence, incidence, and total burden of CVDs.",

          "content": "Leucine is regarded as an anabolic trigger for the mTORC1 pathway and the stimulation muscle protein synthesis rates. More recently, there has been an interest in underpinning the relevance of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-containing dipeptides and their intact absorption into circulation to regulate muscle anabolic responses. We investigated the effects of dileucine and leucine ingestion on postprandial muscle protein turnover. Ten healthy young men (age: 23\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009yr) consumed either 2\u2009g of leucine (LEU) or 2\u2009g of dileucine (DILEU) in a randomized crossover design. The participants underwent repeated blood and muscle biopsy sampling during primed continuous infusions of l-[-C]phenylalanine and l-[N]phenylalanine to determine myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) and mixed muscle protein breakdown rates (MPB), respectively. LEU and DILEU similarly increased plasma leucine net area under the curve (AUC;  = 0.396). DILEU increased plasma dileucine AUC to a greater extent than LEU ( = 0.013). Phosphorylation of Akt ( = 0.002), rpS6 ( < 0.001), and p70S6K ( < 0.001) increased over time under both LEU and DILEU conditions. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 ( = 0.229) and eEF2 ( = 0.999) did not change over time irrespective of condition. Cumulative (0-180\u2009min) MPS increased in DILEU (0.075\u2009\u00b1\u20090.032%\u00b7h), but not in LEU (0.047\u2009\u00b1\u20090.029%\u00b7h;  = 0.023). MPB did not differ between LEU (0.043\u2009\u00b1\u20090.030%\u00b7h) and DILEU conditions (0.051\u2009\u00b1\u20090.027%\u00b7h;  = 0.659). Our results showed that dileucine ingestion elevated plasma dileucine concentrations and muscle protein turnover by stimulating MPS in young men. The role of dipeptides as anabolic agents remains unresolved in humans. We show that the ingestion of 2\u2009g dileucine increased plasma dileucine concentrations and resulted in an enhancement of muscle protein turnover by stimulating an increase in muscle protein synthesis rates in healthy young males. The ingestion of 2\u2009g leucine, however, did not stimulate an increase in muscle protein turnover. Our work provides the first insights into the effects of dipeptides on human protein metabolism.",

However, limited data are currently available on the effects of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and branched-chain ketoacid (BCKA) ingestion on postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of ingesting 6 g BCAA, 6 g BCKA, and 30 g milk protein (MILK) on the postprandial rise in circulating amino acid concentrations and subsequent myofibrillar protein synthesis rates in older males. In a parallel design, 45 older males (age: 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 y; BMI: 25.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to ingest a drink containing 6 g BCAA, 6 g BCKA, or 30 g MILK. Basal and postprandial myofibrillar protein synthesis rates were assessed by primed continuous l-[ring-13C6]phenylalanine infusions with the collection of blood samples and muscle biopsies. Plasma BCAA concentrations increased following test drink ingestion in all groups, with greater increases in the BCAA and MILK groups compared with the BCKA group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Plasma BCKA concentrations increased following test drink ingestion in all groups, with greater increases in the BCKA group compared with the BCAA and MILK groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Ingestion of MILK, BCAA, and BCKA significantly increased early myofibrillar protein synthesis rates (0-2 h) above basal rates (from 0.020\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002%/h to 0.042\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004%/h, 0.022\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002%/h to 0.044\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004%/h, and 0.023\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003%/h to 0.044\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004%/h, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with no differences between groups (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).

However, iAUC of all serum parameters did not differ between CDX and GLC (P\u2009>\u20090.05). T serum EAA showed a trend towards a statistical significance favoring CDX over GLC. The phosphorylation of p70S6K, rpS6, ERK1/2 was greater in CDX compared to GLC (P\u2009<\u20090.05). However, postprandial myofibrillar FSR did not differ between CDX and GLC (P\u2009=\u20090.17).

We included 36 chronic HD patient features of protein energy wasting as plasma albumin <38\u00a0g/L, and dietary intakes <30\u00a0kcal/kg/day and <1\u00a0g protein/kg/day. Patients received either oral BCAA (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0g/day) or glycine (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0g/day) for 4\u00a0months (Period 1), followed by a washout period of 1\u00a0month, and then received the opposite supplement (Period 2). The outcomes were lean body mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, fat-free mass index measured by bioelectrical impedance, resting energy expenditure, dietary intake and appetite rating, physical activity and function, quality of life, and blood parameters. Analyses were performed by multiple mixed linear regressions including type of supplementation, months, period, sex, and age as fixed effects and subjects as random intercepts. Twenty-seven patients (61.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.7\u00a0years, 41% women) were compliant to the supplementations (consumption >80% of packs) and completed the study.

BCAA and glycine intake had no effect on the other clinical parameters, blood chemistry tests, or plasma amino acids. Branched-chain amino acid did not improve lean body mass as compared with glycine. Unexpectedly, glycine improved fat-free mass index in HD patients, as compared with BCAA.

          "content": "Despite the role of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in physiological processes such as nutrient signaling and protein synthesis, there is ongoing debate about the link between circulating BCAAs and insulin resistance (IR) in various populations. In healthy women, IR mildly increases during pregnancy, whereas both BCAAs and markers of BCAA catabolism decrease, indicating that fetal growth is being prioritized. Exercise reduces IR in nonpregnant adults, but less is known about the effect of exercise during pregnancy in women with obesity on IR and BCAA breakdown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a moderate-intensity exercise intervention during pregnancy on maternal circulating BCAAs and markers of BCAA catabolism [short-chain acylcarnitines (ACs)], and their associations with IR. Healthy obese [ = 80, means \u00b1 SD; body mass index (BMI): 36.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7\u2009kg/m] pregnant women were randomized into an exercise ( = 40, aerobic/resistance 3\u00d7/wk, \u223c13th gestation week until birth) or a nonexercise control ( = 40) group. Blood was collected at 12.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 and 36.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 gestation weeks and analyzed for BCAA-derived acylcarnitine concentrations as markers of BCAA breakdown toward oxidative pathways, and glucose and insulin concentrations [updated homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA2-IR)]. After adjusting for HOMA2-IR, there were no interaction effects of group by time. In addition, there was a main positive effect of time on HOMA2-IR (12\u2009wk: 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2, 36\u2009wk: 3.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2,  = 0.003). A moderate-intensity exercise intervention during pregnancy in women with obesity was not associated with changes in BCAA-derived ACs versus standard of care. The decrease in BCAA-derived ACs throughout gestation could not be explained by IR. This research showed an increase in insulin resistance (IR) and decrease in branched-chain amino acid catabolism throughout gestation in women with obesity, and addition of a moderate exercise intervention (known to attenuate IR in nonpregnant populations) did not alter these shifts. Findings provide support for metabolic safety of exercise during pregnancy.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis determined whether the ergogenic effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) ameliorated markers of muscle damage and performance following strenuous exercise. In total, 25 studies were included, consisting of 479 participants (age 24.3 \u00b1 8.3 years, height 1.73 \u00b1 0.06 m, body mass 70.8 \u00b1 9.5 kg, females 26.3%). These studies were rated as fair to excellent following the PEDro scale. The outcome measures were compared between the BCAA and placebo conditions at 24 and 48 hours following muscle-damaging exercises, using standardised mean differences and associated -values via forest plots. Our meta-analysis demonstrated significantly lower levels of indirect muscle damage markers (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and myoglobin) at 48 hours post-exercise (standardised mean difference [SMD] = -0.41;  < 0.05) for the BCAA than placebo conditions, whilst muscle soreness was significant at 24 hours post-exercise (SMD = -0.28 \u2264  \u2264 -0.61;  < 0.05) and 48 hours post-exercise (SMD = -0.41 \u2264 \u2264 -0.92;  < 0.01). However, no significant differences were identified between the BCAA and placebo conditions for muscle performance at 24 or 48 hours post-exercise (SMD = 0.08 \u2264  \u2264 0.21;  > 0.05). Overall, BCAA reduced the level of muscle damage biomarkers and muscle soreness following muscle-damaging exercises. However, the potential benefits of BCAA for muscle performance recovery is questionable and warrants further investigation to determine the practicality of BCAA for ameliorating muscle damage symptoms in diverse populations. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020191248.  BCAA reduces the level of creatine kinase and muscle soreness following strenuous exercise with a dose-response relationship. BCAA does not accelerate recovery for muscle performance.",

          "content": "To reveal the role of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in the development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the effect on the incidence of subsequent cardiovascular disease. A total of 1302 subjects in the cohort study of the Huai'an Diabetes Prevention Program were divided into two groups according to whether NAFLD was present at baseline. The group without NAFLD at baseline was only followed up, and the group with NAFLD at baseline received diet and exercise interventions. Anthropometric and biochemical examinations were performed at baseline and at the end of 4\u00a0years for all subjects. Serum BCAA (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) levels were measured by hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The associations of baseline serum BCAA levels with the risk for NAFLD, coronary heart disease (CHD), and cardiovascular events (CVEs) after 4\u00a0years were further evaluated. (1) At baseline and after the 4-year follow-up, baseline serum leucine, valine, and total BCAAs in the NAFLD group were significantly higher than those in the non-NAFLD group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). (2) According to whether NAFLD was present at baseline and after follow-up, all subjects were divided into four groups, including the control group, new case group, improvement group, and unchanged group. There was no significant difference in baseline BCAAs levels between the new case group and the improvement group (p\u2009>\u20090.05). (3) Risk factors for the occurrence and development of NAFLD were analysed by a multiple logistic regression model according to whether NAFLD existed at baseline. Serum leucine (OR\u2009=\u20091.058, 95% CI 1.005-1.114, p\u2009=\u20090.033) and total BCAAs (OR\u2009=\u20091.023, 95% CI 1.001-1.046, p\u2009=\u20090.045) were independent risk factors for new-onset NAFLD. Serum valine (OR\u2009=\u20091.131, 95% CI 1.043-1.226, p\u2009=\u20090.003), and total BCAAs (OR\u2009=\u20091.040, 95% CI 1.003-1.078, p\u2009=\u20090.035) were independent risk factors showing that NAFLD could not be reversed. (4) The cross-table Chi-square test showed that the incidence of both CHD and CVEs was significantly highest in the new case group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). (5) After adjusting for confounding factors, baseline isoleucine, valine, and BCAA levels were independently associated with new-onset CHD in subjects with or without NAFLD at baseline (p\u2009<\u20090.05). High BCAA levels exacerbate the risk of CHD and CVEs by influencing the occurrence and progression of NAFLD. However, lifestyle interventions could reverse the risk of NAFLD, CHD and CVEs associated with BCAAs.",

          "content": "Concussion is a common injury in the adolescent and young adult populations. Although branched chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation has shown improvements in neurocognitive and sleep function in pre-clinical animal models of mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), to date, no studies have been performed evaluating the efficacy of BCAAs in concussed adolescents and young adults. The goal of this pilot trial was to determine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of varied doses of oral BCAA supplementation in a group of concussed adolescents and young adults. The study was conducted as a pilot, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of participants ages 11-34 presenting with concussion to outpatient clinics (sports medicine and primary care), urgent care, and emergency departments of a tertiary care pediatric children's hospital and an urban tertiary care adult hospital, between June 24, 2014 and December 5, 2020. Participants were randomized to one of five study arms (placebo and 15\u2009g, 30\u2009g, 45\u2009g, and 54\u2009g BCAA treatment daily) and followed for 21 days after enrollment. Outcome measures included daily computerized neurocognitive tests (processing speed, the  primary outcome; and attention, visual learning, and working memory), symptom score, physical and cognitive activity, sleep/wake alterations, treatment compliance, and adverse events. In total, 42 participants were randomized, 38 of whom provided analyzable data. We found no difference in our primary outcome of processing speed between the arms; however, there was a significant reduction in total symptom score (decrease of 4.4 points on a 0-54 scale for every 500\u2009g of study drug consumed,  value for trend\u2009=\u20090.0036, [uncorrected]) and return to physical activity (increase of 0.503 points on a 0-5 scale for every 500\u2009g of study drug consumed,  value for trend\u2009=\u20090.005 [uncorrected]). There were no serious adverse events. Eight of 38 participants reported a mild (not interfering with daily activity) or moderate (limitation of daily activity) adverse event; there were no differences in adverse events by arm, with only two reported mild adverse events (both gastrointestinal) in the highest (45\u2009g and 54\u2009g) BCAA arms. Although limited by slow enrollment, small sample size, and missing data, this study provides the first demonstration of efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability, of BCAAs in concussed adolescents and young adults; specifically, a dose-response effect in reducing concussion symptoms and a return to baseline physical activity in those treated with higher total doses of BCAAs. These findings provide important preliminary data to inform a larger trial of BCAA therapy to expedite concussion recovery.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia, the age-related decrease in muscle mass and function can result in adverse health outcomes and subsequent loss of independence. Inadequate nutrition is an important contributor to the aetiology of sarcopenia, and dietary strategies are studied to prevent or delay this geriatric syndrome. The present study investigated whether there is an association between biochemical nutrient status markers, muscle parameters and sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. Data from the cross-sectional Maastricht Sarcopenia study (MaSS) were used, in which skeletal muscle index (SMI), 4 meter gait speed, 5 times chair stand and handgrip strength were assessed among older adults (n=227). Sarcopenia was defined following the algorithm of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Fasted blood samples were analyses on amino acids levels, RBC phospholipid profile, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), \u03b1-tocopherol, magnesium and homocysteine were determined in fasted blood levels. Generalized linear modelling and logistic regression were used for data analysis. Lower blood levels of essential amino acids (EAA), total branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and leucine were associated with lower SMI (P<0.001), strength (P<0.001) and longer time to complete the chair stand (P<0.05), whereas no association was found for total amino acids (TAA). Lower levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 25(OH)D and homocysteine were associated with lower muscle parameter values (P<0.05). No significant associations were found for SFA, MUFA, PUFA, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), \u03b1-tocopherol-cholesterol ratio and magnesium. Sarcopenia was more frequent among those with lower levels of leucine, BCAA, EAA, EPA, 25(OH)D and higher levels of homocysteine (P<0.05). Age and BMI were identified as relevant covariates. A robust association was only found for lower gait speed and lower 25(OH)D levels. Compromised muscle parameters are associated with low blood values of specific amino acids, fatty acids, vitamin D and high homocysteine.",

          "content": "Taurine has been demonstrated to regulate and improve metabolic health. However, physiological and pathological differences among individuals with overweight or obesity may result in varied responses to taurine supplementation. This study aims to estimate the effects of long-term taurine supplementation on blood lipids, glycemia, and insulin sensitivity in adults with overweight or obesity through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The literature search was based on six databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, and SPORTDiscus) up to October 2024. Subgroup analyses were performed based on daily taurine intake dosage (<3 g or 3 g), overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m), and obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m). The final number of studies that met the inclusion criteria was 9 RCTs. The overall analysis showed that taurine supplementation significantly decreased TG (WMD = -0.56 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.92 to -0.2,  = 0.002,  = 63%), TC (WMD = -0.71 mg/dL, 95% CI: -1.17 to -0.25,  = 0.002,  = 73%), and fasting insulin (WMD = -2.15 \u00b5U/mL, 95% CI: -3.24 to -1.06,  = 0.0001,  = 9%). In the subgroup analysis, long-term taurine intake led to BMI improvement in overweight adults (WMD = -1.14 kg/m, 95% CI: -1.81 to -0.47,  = 0.0008,  = 0%). Meanwhile, improvements in HbA1c (WMD = -0.33%, 95% CI: -0.53 to -0.12,  = 0.002,  = 16%) and HOMA-IR (WMD = -0.91, 95% CI: -1.74 to -0.08,  = 0.003,  = 54%) were observed only in obese participants following taurine supplementation. Additionally, the long-term intake of 3 g of taurine significantly improved HbA1c (WMD = -0.37%, 95% CI: -0.61 to -0.13,  = 0.003,  = 0%) and FPG levels (WMD = -7.14 mg/dL, 95% CI: -12.53 to -1.74,  = 0.003,  = 70%) in overweight/obesity. Long-term taurine supplementation is particularly effective in improving glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in obesity. Furthermore, higher doses of taurine (3 g per day) demonstrate even greater improvements in glycemic control.",

We provide an overview of the scientific literature and present an analysis of the effects of taurine on various aspects of human health, focusing on aging and cardiovascular pathophysiology, but also including athletic performance, metabolic regulation, and neurological function. Additionally, our report summarizes the current recommendations for taurine intake and addresses potential safety concerns. Evidence from both human and animal studies indicates that taurine may have beneficial cardiovascular effects, including blood pressure regulation, improved cardiac fitness, and enhanced vascular health. Its mechanisms of action and antioxidant properties make it also an intriguing candidate for potential anti-aging strategies.",

          "content": "We compared the metabolomic profile of aqueous humor from patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG; n = 26) with that of a group of age- and sex-matched non-POAG controls (n = 26), all participants undergoing cataract surgery. Supervised paired partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed good predictive performance for test sets with a median area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.89 and a p-value of 0.0087. Twenty-three metabolites allowed discrimination between the two groups. Univariate analysis after the Benjamini-Hochberg correction showed significant differences for 13 of these metabolites. The POAG metabolomic signature indicated reduced concentrations of taurine and spermine and increased concentrations of creatinine, carnitine, three short-chain acylcarnitines, 7 amino acids (glutamine, glycine, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, hydroxyl-proline, and acetyl-ornithine), 7 phosphatidylcholines, one lysophosphatidylcholine, and one sphingomyelin. This suggests an alteration of metabolites involved in osmoprotection (taurine and creatinine), neuroprotection (spermine, taurine, and carnitine), amino acid metabolism (7 amino acids and three acylcarnitines), and the remodeling of cell membranes drained by the aqueous humor (hydroxyproline and phospholipids). Five of these metabolic alterations, already reported in POAG plasma, concern spermine, C3 and C4 acylcarnitines, PC aa 34:2, and PC aa 36:4, thus highlighting their importance in the pathogenesis of glaucoma.",

A double-blind, acute, and crossover study design was conducted. Seventeen men (age 24.8 \u00b1 4.07y; BMI: 23.9 \u00b1 2.57 kg/m\u00b2) participated in the present study. Different doses of taurine (TAU) (3 g or 6 g) or placebo were supplemented 90 minutes before a single bout of fasting aerobic exercise (on a treadmill at 60% of VO2 max). The subjects performed three trials, and each one was separated by seven days. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after the exercise protocol of each test to analyze plasma levels of glycerol and taurine. Lipid and carbohydrate oxidation were determined immediately after exercise for 15 minutes by indirect calorimetry. We observed that TAU supplementation (6 g) increased lipid oxidation (38%) and reduced the respiratory coefficient (4%) when compared to the placebo ( < 0.05). However, no differences in lipid oxidation were observed between the different doses of taurine (3 g and 6 g). For glycerol concentrations, there were no differences between trials. Six grams of TAU supplementation 90 minutes before a single bout of aerobic exercise in a fasted state was sufficient to increase the lipid oxidation post-exercise in healthy young men.",

To evaluate the effects of isolated oral taurine ingestion on endurance performance and to assess the contribution of (1) the dose and (2) the supplementation period to the ergogenic effect. A search was performed using various databases in September 2017. The studies were screened using search criteria for eligibility. Ten peer-reviewed articles were identified for inclusion. A sub-analysis of time-to-exhaustion (TTE) trials (n = 7) was also performed. The effects of (1) dose and (2) the acute (single dose) or chronic (> 1 day) supplementation periods were assessed using meta-regression. The doses of taurine ranged from 1 to 6\u00a0g/day and were provided in single doses and for up to 2\u00a0weeks among a range of subjects. Taurine ingestion improved overall endurance performance (Hedges' g\u00a0=\u00a00.40, 95% CI 0.12-0.67, P = 0.004), which was similar in TTE trials (Hedges' g = 0.43, 95% CI 0.12-0.75, P = 0.007). There were no differences between acute or chronic supplementation for the full sample (P = 0.897) or the TTE group (P = 0.896). The dose of taurine did not moderate its effect on endurance performance (P > 0.05). Human endurance performance can be improved by orally ingesting a single dose of taurine in varying amounts (1-6 g).",

While the effectiveness of taurine as an ergogenic aid remains controversial, this paper summarizes the current evidence regarding the efficacy of taurine in aerobic and anaerobic performance, metabolic stress, muscle soreness, and recovery. Google Scholar, Web of Science, and MedLine (PubMed) searches were conducted through September 2020. Peer-reviewed studies that investigated taurine as a single ingredient at dosages of <\u20091\u2009g - 6\u2009g, ranging from 10 to 15\u2009min-to-2\u2009h prior to exercise bout or chronic dose (7\u2009days- 8\u2009weeks) of consumption were included. Articles were excluded if taurine was not the primary or only ingredient in a supplement or food source, not published in peer-reviewed journals, if participants were older than 50\u2009years, articles published before 1999, animal studies, or included participants with health issues. A total of 19 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Key results include improvements in the following: VOmax, time to exhaustion (TTE; n\u2009=\u20095 articles), 3 or 4\u2009km time-trial (n\u2009=\u20092 articles), anaerobic performance (n\u2009=\u20097 articles), muscle damage (n\u2009=\u20093 articles), peak power (n\u2009=\u20092 articles), recovery (n\u2009=\u20091 article). Taurine also caused a change in metabolites: decrease in lactate, creatine kinase, phosphorus, inflammatory markers, and improved glycolytic/fat oxidation markers (n\u2009=\u20095 articles). Taurine dosing appears to be effective at ~\u20091-3\u2009g/day acutely across a span of 6-15\u2009days (1-3\u2009h before an activity) which may improve aerobic performance (TTE), anaerobic performance (strength, power), recovery (DOMS), and a decrease in metabolic markers (creatine kinase, lactate, inorganic phosphate). Limited and varied findings prohibit definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of taurine on aerobic and anaerobic performance and metabolic outcomes. There are mixed findings for the effect of taurine consumption on improving recovery from training bouts and/or mitigating muscle damage. The timing of taurine ingestion as well as the type of exercise protocol performed may contribute to the effectiveness of taurine as an ergogenic aid. More investigations are needed to better understand the potential effects of taurine supplementation on aerobic and anaerobic performance, muscle damage, metabolic stress, and recovery.",

          "content": "Recently, taurine-containing jellies have been sold in Korea, which provides a source of dietary taurine suspended in jelly and considered as a snack. This study was conducted to investigate factors (recognition, consumer preference, and improvement points) that potentially increase the willingness of consumers (Korean college students) to purchase the taurine-containing product. A total of 561 subjects were compared according to gender (260 male and 301 female college students) and degree of interest in taurine-containing jelly (276 subjects interest group and 285 subjects in indifferent group). Data were collected using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire and a consumer preference evaluation. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0. The factors most important in determining the willingness to buy taurine-containing jelly were price and efficacy for male students (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), taste (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and brand (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) for female students. Nutrient and weight were more important in the interest group than the indifferent group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Preference consumer scores of the taurine-containing jelly rated aroma, texture, and taste significantly higher among male college students than those of the female college students. Moreover, preference scores of all items were significantly higher in the interest group than in the indifferent group. The interest group was more knowledgeable about taurine than the indifferent group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Willingness to purchase (average 3.1 points) and intention to recommend (average 3.1 points) the taurine-containing B jelly were significantly higher in the interest group than in the indifferent group. Interest in taurine-containing jelly, overall preference, and intention to recommend in all the subjects were shown to significantly positively correlate with their willingness to purchase. These results show that it is necessary to increase the degree of interest, preference, and intention to recommend to improve the willingness to purchase taurine-containing jelly by Korean college students. In particular, since the subjects who had knowledge of taurine were interested in taurine-containing jelly, nutritional education and promotion of taurine should help in the selling of the product.",

Participants were assessed for whole-body sweat loss (WBSL), local sweat rate (LSR), sweat gland activation (SGA), core temperature (T), breakpoint of compensability (P) and calorimetric heat transfer components. Plasma volume and plasma taurine concentrations were established through pre- and post-trial blood samples.

Evaporative heat loss was enhanced by 27% (p\u2009=\u20090.010), heat-storage reduced by 72% (p\u2009=\u20090.024) and P was greater in taurine vs placebo (25.0-mmHg vs 21.7-mmHg; p\u2009=\u20090.002). Taurine supplementation increased sweating responses during fixed \u1e22 in hot conditions, prior to substantial heat strain and before the breakpoint of compensability, demonstrating improved thermoregulatory capacity.

          "content": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the foremost cause of mortality globally. Taurine, an amino acid, holds promise for cardiovascular health through mechanisms such as calcium regulation, blood pressure reduction, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Despite these potential benefits, previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aims to evaluate the existing evidence on the quantitative effects of taurine on hemodynamic parameters and cardiac function grading, which are indicative of overall cardiovascular health and performance. We conducted an electronic search across multiple databases, including Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov, from their inception to January 2, 2024. Our analysis focused on key cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and New York Heart Association (NYHA)\u00a0Functional Classification. Meta-regression was applied to explore dose-dependent relationships based on the total taurine dose administered during the treatment period. A subgroup analysis, stratified according to the baseline disease status of patients, was also conducted. The analysis included a pooled sample of 808 participants from 20 randomized controlled trials. Taurine demonstrated a significant reduction in HR (weighted mean difference [WMD]\u2009=\u2009-3.579\u00a0bpm, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u2009-6.044 to -1.114, p\u2009=\u20090.004), SBP (WMD\u2009=\u2009-3.999\u00a0mm Hg, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-7.293 to -0.706, p\u2009=\u20090.017), DBP (WMD: -1.435\u00a0mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.484 to -0.386, p\u2009=\u20090.007), NYHA (WMD: -0.403, 95% CI: -0.522 to -0.283, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and a significant increase in LVEF (WMD: 4.981%, 95% CI: 1.556 to 8.407, p\u2009=\u20090.004). Meta-regression indicated a dose-dependent reduction in HR (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.0150 per g, p\u2009=\u20090.333), SBP (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.0239 per g, p\u2009=\u20090.113), DBP (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.0089 per g, p\u2009=\u20090.110), and NYHA (coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.0016 per g, p\u2009=\u20090.111), and a positive correlation with LVEF (coefficient\u2009=\u20090.0285 per g, p\u2009=\u20090.308). No significant adverse effects were observed compared to controls. In subgroup analysis, taurine significantly improved HR in heart failure patients and healthy individuals. Taurine significantly reduced SBP in healthy individuals, heart failure patients, and those with other diseases, while significantly lowered DBP in hypertensive patients It notably increased LVEF in heart failure patients and improved NYHA functional class in both heart failure patients and those with other diseases. Taurine showed noteworthy effects in preventing hypertension and enhancing cardiac function. Individuals prone to CVDs may find it advantageous to include taurine in their daily regimen.",

          "content": "The onset and progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) is a multistage process spanning years or several decades. Some bile acid (BA) features are identified as indicators for CLD progression. However, BAs are highly influenced by various factors and are stage and/or population specific. Emerging evidences demonstrated the association of structure of conjugated BAs and CLD progression. Here, we aimed to investigate the alteration of conjugated BAs and identify new features for CLD progression. Based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platform, 15 BAs were quantified in 1883 participants including healthy controls and CLD patients (non-alcoholic fatty liver [NAFL], non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH], fibrosis, cirrhosis, and three types of liver cancer). Logistic regression was used to construct diagnostic models. Model performances were evaluated in discovery and test sets by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa index. Five BA glycine\u00a0:\u00a0taurine ratios were calculated, and glycocholic acid/taurocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid/taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid/taurochenocholic acid were identified as candidates. Three diagnostic models were constructed for the differentiation of healthy control and early CLD (NAFL\u00a0+\u00a0NASH), early and advanced CLD (fibrosis\u00a0+\u00a0cirrhosis\u00a0+\u00a0liver cancer), and NAFL and NASH, respectively. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the models ranged from 0.91 to 0.97. The addition of age and gender improved model performances further. The alterations of the candidates and the performances of the diagnostic models were successfully validated by independent test sets (n\u00a0=\u00a0291). Our findings revealed stage-specific BA perturbation patterns and provided new biomarkers and tools for the monitoring of liver disease progression.",

          "content": "This study examined 1) the plasma taurine response to acute oral taurine supplementation (T), and 2) the effects of 7 days of T on muscle amino acid content and substrate metabolism during 2 h of cycling at approximately 60% peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). In the first part of the study, after an overnight fast, 7 volunteers (28+/-3 yr, 184+/-2 cm, 88.0+/-6.6 kg) ingested 1.66 g oral taurine doses with breakfast (8 AM) and lunch (12 noon), and blood samples were taken throughout the day. In the second part of the study, eight men (22+/-1 yr, 181+/-1 cm, 80.9+/-3.8 kg, 4.21+/-0.16 l/min VO2peak) cycled for 2 h after 7 days of placebo (P) ingestion (6 g glucose/day) and again following 7 days of T (5 g/day). In the first part of the study, plasma taurine was 64+/-4 microM before T and rose rapidly to 778+/-139 microM by 10 AM and remained elevated at noon (359+/-56 microM). Plasma taurine reached 973+/-181 microM at 1 PM and was 161+/-31 microM at 4 PM. In the second part of the study, seven days of T had no effect on muscle taurine content (mmol/kg dry muscle) at rest (P, 44+/-15 vs. T, 42+/-15) or after exercise (P, 43+/-12 vs. T, 43+/-11). There was no difference in muscle glycogen or other muscle metabolites between conditions, but there were notable interaction effects for muscle valine, isoleucine, leucine, cystine, glutamate, alanine, and arginine amino acid content following exercise after T. These data indicate that 1) acute T produces a 13-fold increase in plasma taurine concentration; 2) despite the ability to significantly elevate plasma taurine for extended periods throughout the day, 7 days of T does not alter skeletal muscle taurine content or carbohydrate and fat oxidation during exercise; and 3) T appears to have some impact on muscle amino acid response to exercise.",

          "content": "To summarize the available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of taurine supplementation on growth in low birth weight infants (LBW). PubMed, EmBase, and Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched for published articles through March 2017. Analysis was done to examine the effect of taurine supplementation on growth, and sensitivity analysis was performed by removing each individual study from meta-analysis. Results of 9 trials totaling 216 LBW infants in the present meta-analysis were collected and analyzed. The conclusion of included studies demonstrated that taurine supplementation significantly reduced length gain (WMD:-0.18; P\u2009<\u20090.001), plasma glycine (WMD:-106.71; P\u2009=\u20090.033), alanine (WMD:-229.30; P\u2009=\u20090.002), leucine (WMD:-64.76; P\u2009<\u20090.001), tyrosine (WMD:-118.11; P\u2009<\u20090.001), histidine (WMD:-52.16; P\u2009<\u20090.001), proline (WMD: -84.29; P\u2009=\u20090.033), and asparagine-glutamine (WMD:-356.30; P\u2009<\u20090.001). However, taurine supplementation was associated with higher levels of acidic sterols (WMD:0.61; P\u2009=\u20090.024), total fatty acids (WMD:7.94; P\u2009=\u20090.050), total saturated fatty acids (WMD:9.70; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and unsaturated fatty acids (WMD:6.63; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Finally, taurine supplementation had little or no significant effect on weight gain, head circumference gain, plasma taurine, threonine, serine, citrulline, valine, methionine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, ornithine, lysine, arginine, glutamate, hydroxyproline, aspartate, dietary cholesterol, endogenous neutral sterols, cholesterol synthesis, and medium-chain triglycerides. The findings suggest that although there are several significant differences in plasma indeces, no significant effect on growth in LBW infants was observed with taurine supplementation.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the acute effects of a single dose of taurine supplementation on exercise performance and examined potential moderators related to participant characteristics, exercise modality, dosing, and administration protocols. Six electronic databases were searched up to July 2025, identifying 23 eligible randomized trials (k\u2009=\u200969, N\u2009=\u2009308). A three-level random-effects meta-analysis indicated that acute taurine ingestion may be associated with small-to-moderate improvements in overall performance (g\u2009=\u20090.25, 95% CI [0.10, 0.39], I\u2009=\u200961%). Moderator analyses suggested that benefits were more apparent in males and across aerobic endurance, strength/power, and agility/coordination tasks, whereas evidence for anaerobic capacity and muscular endurance remained inconsistent. No significant dose-response relationship was detected within the commonly used 1-6\u2009g range, suggesting potential threshold effects rather than linear trends. Both capsule and beverage formulations appeared effective, and nonlinear meta-regression indicated that ingestion about 1\u2009h before exercise might yield the most favorable outcomes, although this timing effect was not robust in sensitivity analyses. Further analyses showed that several subgroup effects were attenuated after excluding influential studies, and prediction intervals frequently included the null, reflecting uncertainty in replicability. The overall certainty of evidence, assessed using GRADE, was rated low to very low due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias. Collectively, these findings suggest that acute single-dose taurine supplementation holds promise as an ergogenic aid, but its effectiveness likely varies depending on dosage, blinding procedures, and exercise context. Additional high-quality trials are needed to establish more definitive recommendations.",

Since taurine body content decreases with aging, we investigated the effects of supplementation (alone and combined with exercise) on oxidative stress, extracellular matrix degradation, white blood cells, neurotrophins, cognition and physical fitness of elderly women. Forty-eight women (83.58\u2009\u00b1\u20096.98\u00a0years) were enrolled into exercise training only (EO: n\u2009=\u200913), taurine supplementation (TS: n\u2009=\u200912), exercise training\u2009+\u2009taurine supplementation (ETTS: n\u2009=\u200911), and control group (CG: n\u2009=\u200912). All interventions lasted 14\u00a0weeks. Exercise was applied twice a week, and taurine was given once a day (1.5\u00a0g). Data collection occurred before and after interventions with the determination of myeloperoxidase (MPO), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF) levels, and white blood cell counts (WBC). Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and physical fitness tests were also evaluated. Concentration of MPO and MMP-9 decreased after intervention in TS (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No effect of time or time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0group was observed for WBC parameters; however, univariate analysis showed a significant decrease in lymphocytes for TS, while an increase in monocytes occurred in the CG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). MoCA scores decreased over time in the CG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Improvements in physical fitness occurred in ETTS (better agility and aerobic capacity), mostly likely due to exercise and boosted by taurine supplementation. No changes in BDNF levels were observed (p\u2009>\u20090.05), while NGF concentration were undetectable in almost subjects.

          "content": "Skeletal muscle wasting, associated with aging, may be regulated by the inflammatory cytokines as well as by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). l-carnitine possesses anti-inflammatory properties and increases plasma IGF-1 concentration, leading to the regulation of the genes responsible for protein catabolism and anabolism. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a 24-week l-carnitine supplementation on serum inflammatory markers, IGF-1, body composition and skeletal muscle strength in healthy human subjects over 65 years of age. Women between 65 and 70 years of age were supplemented for 24 weeks with either 1500 mg l-carnitine-l-tartrate or an isonitrogenous placebo per day in a double-blind fashion. Before and after the supplementation protocol, body mass and composition, as well as knee extensor and flexor muscle strength were determined. In the blood samples, free carnitine, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, C-reactive protein and IGF-1 were determined. A marked increase in free plasma carnitine concentration was observed due to l-carnitine supplementation. No substantial changes in other parameters were noted. In the current study, supplementation for 24 weeks affected neither the skeletal muscle strength nor circulating markers in healthy women over 65 years of age. Positive and negative aspects of l-carnitine supplementation need to be clarified.",

          "content": "There are many causes for carnitine depletion during maintenance hemodialysis. Supplementation with L-carnitine in animals has been associated with improvement in some abnormalities also present in chronic renal failure. However, it is still controversial whether restoring plasma or tissue carnitine will correct clinical or biologic symptoms observed in maintenance hemodialysis. A systematic review is here performed to determine the effects of L-carnitine in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Eighty-three prospective trials were identified from 1978 to 1999 in which L-carnitine was randomly allocated in 21 trials. Change in serum triglycerides, cholesterol fractions, hemoglobin levels, erythropoietin dose, and other symptoms (muscle function, exercise capacity, and quality of life) were examined. A total of 482 patients in 18 trials were considered for analysis. There was no effect of L-carnitine on triglycerides, total cholesterol, or any of its fractions. Before the erythropoietin (EPO) era, L-carnitine treatment was associated with improved hemoglobin (P < 0.01) and with a decreased EPO dose (P < 0.01) and improved resistance to EPO when patients routinely received EPO. Muscle function, exercise capacity, and quality of life could not be reliably assessed because of the noncombinable nature of end points and the limited number of trials. In conclusion, L-carnitine cannot be recommended for treating the dyslipidemia of maintenance hemodialysis patients. By contrast, this review suggests a promising effect of L-carnitine on anemia management. The route of L-carnitine administration should be evaluated because there is no evidence as to the most efficient method of administration in maintenance hemodialysis.",

One hundred fifty patients with oligoasthenozoospermia were randomized selected into treatment and control groups. The treatment group with 90 patients were given L-carnitine (2 g/d) and acetyl-L-carnitine (1 g/d) orally, twice a day. The patients in control group were given Vitamin E 100 mg plus Vitamin C 100 mg, tid. The oral therapy lasted three months and patients accepted sperm analysis every one month. The L-carnitine level in seminal plasma was examined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPC). Side effects as well as pregnant rate were observed. In the treatment group, 85 patients out of 90 finished the three month treatment. Female spouses of 10 patients (11.6%) achieved pregnancy. Moreover, their forward motile sperm per ejaculation, total motile sperm, as well as the concentration of L-carnitine in seminal plasma were increased significantly (P < 0.01). In control group, 53 patients out of 60 completed three months therapy. Two pregnancy (3.7%) was observed. Though some increase was seen in number of forward motile sperm and total motile sperm per ejaculation, the changes were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The difference of the pregnant rate between two groups was statistically significant. No side effects were found. Combined treatment with L-carnitine and acetyl-L-calmitine can be an effective and safe option for treating oligoasthenozoospermia by means of significantly improving forward motile sperm and total motile sperm per ejaculation, as well as increasing pregnant rates.",

          "content": "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep abnormalities. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a novel narcolepsy-related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which is located adjacent to the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B) gene encoding an enzyme involved in \u03b2-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. The mRNA expression levels of CPT1B were associated with this SNP. In addition, we recently reported that acylcarnitine levels were abnormally low in narcolepsy patients. To assess the efficacy of oral L-carnitine for the treatment of narcolepsy, we performed a clinical trial administering L-carnitine (510 mg/day) to patients with the disease. The study design was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over and placebo-controlled trial. Thirty narcolepsy patients were enrolled in our study. Two patients were withdrawn and 28 patients were included in the statistical analysis (15 males and 13 females, all with HLA-DQB1*06:02). L-carnitine treatment significantly improved the total time for dozing off during the daytime, calculated from the sleep logs, compared with that of placebo-treated periods. L-carnitine efficiently increased serum acylcarnitine levels, and reduced serum triglycerides concentration. Differences in the Japanese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) vitality and mental health subscales did not reach statistical significance between L-carnitine and placebo.

Exercise induces health benefits, but acute exertion up-regulates oxidative stress responses in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of L-carnitine supplementation on i) exercise performance and ii) blood redox status both at rest and after exercise. Twelve hemodialysis patients received either L-carnitine (20 mg kg(-1) i.v.) or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, and crossover design for 8 wk. Participants performed an exercise test to exhaustion before and after supplementation. During the test, V\u02d9O2, respiratory quotient, heart rate, and time to exhaustion were monitored. Blood samples, collected before and after exercise, were analyzed for lactate, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls, reduced and oxidized glutathione, antioxidant capacity, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity. Blood carnitine increased by L-carnitine supplementation proportionately at rest and after exercise. L-carnitine supplementation increased time to fatigue (22%) and decreased postexercise lactate (37%), submaximal heart rate, and respiratory quotient but did not affect V\u02d9O2peak. L-carnitine supplementation increased reduced/oxidized glutathione (2.7-fold at rest, 4-fold postexercise) and glutathione peroxidase activity (4.5% at rest, 10% postexercise) and decreased malondialdehyde (19% at rest and postexercise) and protein carbonyl (27% at rest, 40% postexercise) concentration. Data suggest that a 2-month L-carnitine supplementation may be effective in attenuating oxidative stress responses, enhancing antioxidant status, and improving performance of patients with end-stage renal disease.",

          "content": "The clinical use of acetyl carnitine in circulatory shock has its theoretical basis in the ability of this molecule to restore enzyme activity inhibited by hypoxia, acting as an acetyl donor. Moreover the action of carnitine on an injured myocardium encouraged us to examine the clinical effect of this drug during heart failure. A double-blind clinical study was performed in ten Italian intensive care units on 115 patients with septic, cardiac of traumatic shock, by using acetyl-L-carnitine infusion for 12 hours, with a previous single bolus intravenously. The results showed a good response to the drug in terms of blood oxygenation during the course of sepsis and heart failure. The heart rate as well as right atrial pressure decreased significantly in patients with cardiogenic shock. In septic patients systolic and mean arterial pressures increased also. The present data suggests the use of acetyl-L-carnitine as an adjuvant to the commonly used therapy in hypoxic conditions.",

          "content": "This study was performed to test the hypothesis that urinary levels of L-carnitine and its derivatives are enhanced in children and adolescents with hypertension and also check if analyzed parameters may serve as early markers of subclinical renal damage. The study included 112 children and adolescents (67 males and 45 females) aged median 10-18 years. Participants were divided into two groups: HT-64 subjects with confirmed primary hypertension and R-reference group-48 subjects with white-coat hypertension. Urinary Free and Total L-carnitine were determined by the enzymatic method of Cederblad. The L-carnitine levels were expressed as urinary ratio in micromole per gram creatinine (\u03bcmol/g). The urinary excretion of Total and Free L-carnitine was significantly higher in hypertensive adolescents in comparison to reference group-white coat hypertension. Other important findings were positive correlations between Free L-carnitine/cr., Total L-carnitine/cr. ratio and serum uric acid level, serum cholesterol level and systolic blood pressure. The results of this study do not explain the increased urine levels of L-carnitine. The most likely reason for excessive urinary loss was disturbed renal tubular reabsorption. It is possible to hypothesize that in hypertensive adolescents subclinical kidney dysfunction occurs. It is proposed that studies examining the concurrent plasma and urine concentration of L-carnitine and correlation with acknowledged proximal tubular markers are needed.",

Measurements were made on venous blood samples collected during each experiment at fixed time intervals over an initial rest of 45 min, 60 min bicycle exercise performed near 50% VO2max and 120 min recovery. Free and total plasma carnitine levels reached a plateau corresponding to an average rise of 25% for both fractions, 9-10 days after the beginning of the L-carn diet. These levels returned to their initial values 6-8 weeks after cessation of the supply. Generally L-carn supplementation did not significantly modify the physiological parameters and circulating metabolites. No distinct increase of the relative participation of endogenous lipids in the fuel supply of prolonged submaximal exercise was observed. In normal human subjects the increased demand for fatty acid oxidation resulting from exercise seems to be adequately supported by endogenous levels of carnitine.",

Muscle carnitine (vastus lateralis), VO(2peak), exercise time to fatigue, anaerobic threshold, anaerobic power, and total work were measured at baseline and after an 8-wk aerobic-training program. There were no statistical differences (p> .05) between or within the 3 groups for any performance-related variable or muscle carnitine concentrations after 8 wk of supplementation and training.

Two groups of healthy, untrained subjects were studied in double-blind cross-over trails. Oral supplementation of 2 g per day L-carnitine was used for 2 weeks in the first trial and the same dose but for 4 weeks in the second trial. Maximum and submaximum exercise capacity were assessed during a continuous progressive cycle ergometer exercise test performed at 70 rpm. In trial 1, plasma concentrations of lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate were measured pre- and post-exercise. In trial 2, pre- and post-exercise plasma lactate were measured. The results of treatment with L-carnitine demonstrated no significant changes in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) or in maximum heart rate. In trial 1, there was a small improvement in submaximal performance as evidenced by a decrease in the heart-rate response to a work-load requiring 50% of VO2max. The more extensive trial 2 did not reproduce the significant result obtained in trial 1, that is, there was no significant decrease in heart rate at any given submaximal exercise intensity, under carnitine-supplemented conditions. Plasma metabolic concentrations were unchanged following L-carnitine, in both trials. It is concluded, that in contrast to other reports, carnitine supplementation may be of little benefit to exercise performance since the observed effects were small and inconsistent.",

          "content": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a common and devastating neuropsychiatric complication of acute liver failure or chronic liver disease. Ammonia content in the blood seems to play a role in the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment for hepatic encephalopathy is complex. Acetyl-L-carnitine is a substance that may reduce ammonia toxicity. This review assessed the benefits and harms of acetyl-L-carnitine for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. To assess the benefits and harms of acetyl-L-carnitine for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded for randomised clinical trials. We sought additional randomised clinical trials from the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We performed all electronic searches until 10 September 2018. We looked through the reference lists of retrieved publications and review articles, and we searched the FDA and EMA websites. We searched for randomised clinical trials in any setting, recruiting people with hepatic encephalopathy. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared acetyl-L-carnitine plus standard care (e.g. antibiotics, lactulose) versus placebo or no acetyl-L-carnitine plus standard care. We are well aware that by selecting randomised clinical trials, we placed greater focus on potential benefits than on potential harms. We selected randomised clinical trials, assessed risk of bias in eight domains, and extracted data in a duplicate and independent fashion. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using I\u00b2 and D\u00b2 statistics. We subjected our analyses to fixed-effect and random-effects model meta-analyses. We assessed bias risk domains to control systematic errors. We assessed overall quality of the data for each individual outcome by using the GRADE approach. We identified five randomised clinical trials involving 398 participants. All trials included only participants with cirrhosis as the underlying cause of hepatic encephalopathy. Trials included participants with covert or overt hepatic encephalopathy. All trials were conducted in Italy by a single team and assessed acetyl-L-carnitine compared with placebo. Oral intervention was the most frequent route of administration. All trials were at high risk of bias and were underpowered. None of the trials were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.None of the identified trials reported information on all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, or days of hospitalisation. Only one trial assessed quality of life using the Short Form (SF)-36 scale (67 participants; very low-quality evidence). The effects of acetyl-L-carnitine compared with placebo on general health at 90 days are uncertain (MD -6.20 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.51 to -2.89). Results for additional domains of the SF-36 are also uncertain. One trial assessed fatigue using the Wessely and Powell test (121 participants; very low-quality evidence). The effects are uncertain in people with moderate-grade hepatic encephalopathy (mental fatigue: MD 0.40 points, 95% CI -0.21 to 1.01; physical fatigue: MD -0.20 points, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.52) and mild-grade hepatic encephalopathy (mental fatigue: -0.80 points, 95% CI -1.48 to -0.12; physical fatigue: 0.20 points, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.12). Meta-analysis showed a reduction in blood ammonium levels favouring acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo (MD -13.06 mg/dL, 95% CI -17.24 to -8.99; 387 participants; 5 trials; very low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo increases the risk of non-serious adverse events (8/126 (6.34%) vs 3/120 (2.50%); RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.68 to 9.22; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). Overall, adverse events data were poorly reported and harms may have been underestimated. This Cochrane systematic review analysed a heterogeneous group of five trials at high risk of bias and with high risk of random errors conducted by only one research team. We assessed acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo in participants with cirrhosis with covert or overt hepatic encephalopathy. Hence, we have no data on the drug for hepatic encephalopathy in acute liver failure. We found no information about all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, or days of hospitalisation. We found no clear differences in effect between acetyl-L-carnitine and placebo regarding quality of life, fatigue, and non-serious adverse events. Acetyl-L-carnitine reduces blood ammonium levels compared with placebo. We rated all evidence as of very low quality due to pitfalls in design and execution, inconsistency, small sample sizes, and very few events. The harms profile for acetyl-L-carnitine is presently unclear. Accordingly, we need further randomised clinical trials to assess acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo conducted according to the SPIRIT statements and reported according to the CONSORT statements.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of L-carnitine supplementation on NAFLD. We searched in four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) from inception to 1 November 2022 (updated on March 20, 2023) for potentially relevant records without language restrictions. We collected information on the first author, publication year, country, setting, study design, population characteristics, duration of follow-up, outcome variables of interest, and sources of funding. We used a modified Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the risk of bias, used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence, and used the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) tool to assess the credibility of any apparent subgroup effect. This systematic review and meta-analysis included eight eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Compared to placebo,\u00a0low certainty evidence show that L-carnitine supplementation significantly changes (reduced) more\u00a0in AST levels and ALT levels (MD:\u2009-\u200926.38, 95%CI:\u2009-\u200945.46 to\u2009-\u20097.30),\u00a0and\u00a0moderate certainty evidence show that L-carnitine supplementation significantly changes (reduced)\u00a0more\u00a0in HDL cholesterol levels (MD: 1.14, 95%CI: 0.21 to 2.07) and triglyceride levels (MD:\u2009-\u20096.92, 95%CI:\u2009-\u200913.82 to\u2009-\u20090.03). Moderate credibility of ICEMAN results shows that L-carnitine supplementation has no difference in changes of AST and ALT levels in younger ones (MD: 0.5, 95%CI:\u2009-\u20090.70 to 1.70) but has significant changes (reduced) in adults (MD:\u2009-\u200920.3, 95%CI:\u2009-\u200928.62 to\u2009-\u200912.28)\u00a0compared to placebo. L-carnitine supplementation may improve liver function and regulate triglyceride metabolism in patients with NAFLD, and with no significant adverse effects.",

          "content": "The consumption of dietary amino acids has been evaluated for therapeutic and safety intervention in obesity. In particular, three molecules have been shown to be effective: arginine, glutamine and leucine (and its metabolite beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, HMB). This randomized, double-blinded pilot study in obese postmenopausal patients aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the administration of a specific food for special medical purposes (FSMP) consisting of arginine, glutamine and HMB on body composition, in particular, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), as the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate the effects on skin health through a validated self-reported questionnaire. A significant improvement on VAT of \u0394 = -153.600,  = 0.01 was recorded in the intervention group. Skin health showed a significant improvement in the treatment group for the following: bright \u0394 = 1.400 (0.758; 2.042), elasticity \u0394 = 0.900 (0.239; 1.561), wrinkles \u0394 = 0.800 (0.276; 1.324), and on total score, \u0394 = 3.000 (1.871; 4.129). In the intervention group, the improvement in VAT was associated with an improvement in the bright score (r = -0.58;  = 0.01). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the intake for 4-weeks of arginine, glutamine and HMB effects a significant reduction in VAT and improves skin condition, while fat free mass (FFM) is maintained, thus achieving \"high-quality\" weight loss.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether three-week supplementation of L-glutamine could benefit the mucosal immunity and hormonal status of combat-sport athletes as well as their rates of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and subjective feelings of well-being after intensive training. Twenty-one combat-sport athletes from the National Taiwan University of Sport were recruited in this study. After intensive training, two groups of the participants were asked to consume powder form of 0.3\u2009g/kg body weight of L-glutamine (GLU group) or maltodextrin (PLA group) with drinking water in a randomized design at the same time every day during 3 weeks. Saliva samples were collected to measure immunoglobulin A (IgA), nitric oxide (NO), testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) before and after three-week supplementation; moreover, Hooper's index questionnaires were completed for wellness assessment. The incidence and duration of URTI were recorded by using a health checklist throughout the entire study period. Supplementation of L-glutamine significantly enhanced the concentrations of IgA and NO in saliva; additionally, the incidence of URTI was significantly reduced. Regarding hormones, T concentration was significantly decreased in the PLA group, whereas C concentration was significantly increased, resulting in a significant decrease of T/C ratio. In contrast, the GLU group showed a significant increase of T/C ratio, while the mood scores of the Hooper's index questionnaire were higher in the PLA group. Three-week supplementation of L-glutamine after intensive training enhanced the mucosal immunity, improved hormonal status and reduced the rate of URTI of combat-sport athletes while feelings of well-being were also enhanced. Therefore, L-glutamine would be beneficial for the sports performance and recovery of athletes.",

          "content": "Pressure ulcers pose a significant health challenge, requiring effective management strategies. Nutrition, particularly arginine and glutamine, supports collagen synthesis and tissue repair. This review evaluates the role of enteral glutamine and arginine supplementation on wound healing outcomes, addressing gaps in previous research. A PRISMA-guided systematic search of five databases identified studies published between 2004 and 2024 on adults with pressure ulcers receiving these supplements. Outcomes assessed included healing time, wound size reduction, local infection, recurrence, and pain. A narrative synthesis was performed due to heterogeneity, with bias assessed via Cochrane RoB2 and JBI checklists. Fifteen studies involving 1085 participants were included. Findings indicated a trend toward improved healing with arginine or combined arginine/glutamine supplements, with relative wound size reductions of 18.6% to 98.2% over 2 to 20\u2009weeks. However, inconsistencies were noted, with seven studies showing non-significant or unreported differences in wound size, and six studies with similar issues for healing time. Glutamine was examined only in combination with arginine, limiting insights into its isolated effects. None of the studies reported on recurrence or pain outcomes. While arginine shows potential for enhancing healing, evidence remains inconclusive. Future research should emphasise follow-up until complete wound closure and explore the independent effects of glutamine on wound healing outcomes.",

          "content": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, no specific treatment options are available, emphasizing the need for preventive measures. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of glutamine on [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] levels at the end of the intervention period. In a randomized clinical, double-blind pilot study, 64 eligible cardiac surgery patients at high risk for AKI identified by high urinary [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] were randomized, and body weight-adapted intravenous glutamine or saline-control was administered continuously for 12 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was urinary [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] at the end of the 12-hour study period. Secondary outcomes included kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) at 12 hours, overall AKI rates at 72 hours, free days through day 28 of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medication, renal recovery at day 90, requirement of renal replacement therapy and mortality each at days 30, 60, and 90, length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, and major adverse kidney events consisting of mortality, dialysis dependency, and persistent renal dysfunction (serum creatinine \u22652\u00d7 compared to baseline value) at day 90 (major adverse kidney event; MAKE 90 ). Sixty-four patients (mean age, 68.38 [standard deviation {SD} \u00b1 10.48] years; 10 of 64 women) were enrolled and randomized. Patients received coronary artery bypass graft surgery (32/64), valve surgery (18/64), coronary artery bypass graft and valve surgery (6/64), or other procedures (8/64). Mean on-pump time was 68.38 (standard deviation \u00b1 10.48) minutes. After glutamine administration, urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] was significantly lower in the glutamine compared to the control group (primary end point, intervention: median, 0.18 [Q1, Q3; 0.09, 0.29], controls: median, 0.44 [Q1, Q3; 0.14, 0.79]; P = .01). In addition, [KIM-1] and [NGAL] were also significantly lower in the glutamine group. The overall AKI rate within 72 hours was not different among groups: (intervention 11/31 [35.5%] versus control 8/32 [25.0%]; P = .419; relative risk [RR], 0.86% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.62-1.20]). There were no differences regarding secondary end points. Glutamine significantly decreased markers of kidney damage in cardiac surgery patients at high risk for AKI. Future trials have to be performed to investigate whether the administration of glutamine might be able to reduce the occurrence of AKI after cardiac surgery.",

          "content": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of oral glutamine supplementation combined with resistance training in young adults. A group of 31 subjects, aged 18-24 years, were randomly allocated to groups (double blind) to receive either glutamine (0.9 g x kg lean tissue mass(-1) x day(-1); n = 17) or a placebo (0.9 g maltodextrin x kg lean tissue mass(-1) x day(-1); n = 14 during 6 weeks of total body resistance training. Exercises were performed for four to five sets of 6-12 repetitions at intensities ranging from 60% to 90% 1 repetition maximum (1 RM). Before and after training, measurements were taken of 1 RM squat and bench press strength, peak knee extension torque (using an isokinetic dynamometer), lean tissue mass (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) and muscle protein degradation (urinary 3-methylhistidine by high performance liquid chromatography). Repeated measures ANOVA showed that strength, torque, lean tissue mass and 3-methylhistidine increased with training (P < 0.05), with no significant difference between groups. Both groups increased their 1 RM squat by approximately 30% and 1 RM bench press by approximately 14%. The glutamine group showed increases of 6% for knee extension torque, 2% for lean tissue mass and 41% for urinary levels of 3-methylhistidine. The placebo group increased knee extension torque by 5%, lean tissue mass by 1.7% and 3-methylhistidine by 56%. We conclude that glutamine supplementation during resistance training has no significant effect on muscle performance, body composition or muscle protein degradation in young healthy adults.",

          "content": "Sarcopenia, characterized by degenerative skeletal muscle loss, is increasingly linked to poor surgical outcomes. Glutamine, an immune-modulating formula, may stimulate muscle protein synthesis and inhibit degradation. We used the psoas major muscle area (PMMA) at the third lumbar vertebra, normalized for height (PMMA index), as a skeletal muscle indicator. This study investigates whether perioperative glutamine supplementation mitigates psoas muscle atrophy. We enrolled gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) patients undergoing gastrectomy. Computed tomography assessed the psoas muscle short axis. Muscle atrophy was estimated by changes between preoperative and three-month post-gastrectomy scans. Perioperative glutamine supplementation (PGS) comprised five-day parenteral plus one-month oral use. Propensity score matching minimized potential bias. A linear regression model predicted the association. Of 516 patients analyzed (2016-2019), 100 (19.4%) received PGS. After propensity score matching, each group contained 97 cases. The PGS group showed a significantly higher median PMMA index change than the non-PGS group (0.3 vs. -0.3 cm/m,  = 0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed that PGS was significantly associated with increased PMMA index (coefficient = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.19-1.01;  = 0.005). PGS may help restore psoas muscle atrophy in GA patients undergoing gastrectomy. The underlying mechanisms likely relate to glutamine's role in protein metabolism and immune function. Further studies are needed to elucidate these mechanisms fully.",

This study aims to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of arginine and glutamine supplementation on wound healing. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed for the systematic review and ten electronic databases were used. Five and 39 human studies met the inclusion criteria for arginine and glutamine, respectively. The overall meta-analysis demonstrated a significant effect of arginine supplementation on hydroxyproline content (MD: 4.49, 95% CI: 3.54, 4.45,  < 0.00001). Regarding glutamine supplementation, there was significant effect on nitrogen balance levels (MD: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.58,  < 0.0001), IL-6 levels (MD: -5.78, 95% CI: -8.71, -2.86,  = 0.0001), TNF\u03b1 levels (MD: -8.15, 95% CI: -9.34, -6.96,  < 0.00001), lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio (MD: -0.01, 95% CI: -0.02, -0.01,  < 0.00001), patient mortality (OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.72,  = 0.0004), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (MD: -1.10, 95% CI: -1.26, -0.93,  < 0.00001) and length of hospital stay (LOS) (MD: -2.65, 95% CI: -3.10, -2.21,  < 0.00001). Regarding T-cell lymphocytes, a slight decrease was observed, although it failed to reach significance (MD: -0.16, 95% CI: -0.33, 0.01,  = 0.07).

          "title": "Glutamine, exercise and immune function. Links and possible mechanisms.",
          "content": "Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in human muscle and plasma and is utilised at high rates by rapidly dividing cells, including leucocytes, to provide energy and optimal conditions for nucleotide biosynthesis. As such, it is considered to be essential for proper immune function. During various catabolic states including surgical trauma, infection, starvation and prolonged exercise, glutamine homeostasis is placed under stress. Falls in the plasma glutamine level (normal range 500 to 750 mumol/L after an overnight fast) have been reported following endurance events and prolonged exercise. These levels remain unchanged or temporarily elevated after short term, high intensity exercise. Plasma glutamine has also been reported to fall in patients with untreated diabetes mellitus, in diet-induced metabolic acidosis and in the recovery period following high intensity intermittent exercise. Common factors among all these stress states are rises in the plasma concentrations of cortisol and glucagon and an increased tissue requirement for glutamine for gluconeogenesis. It is suggested that increased gluconeogenesis and associated increases in hepatic, gut and renal glutamine uptake account for the depletion of plasma glutamine in catabolic stress states, including prolonged exercise. The short term effects of exercise on the plasma glutamine level may be cumulative, since heavy training has been shown to result in low plasma glutamine levels (< 500 mumol/L) requiring long periods of recovery. Furthermore, athletes experiencing discomfort from the overtraining syndrome exhibit lower resting levels of plasma glutamine than active healthy controls. Therefore, physical activity directly affects the availability of glutamine to the leucocytes and thus may influence immune function. The utility of plasma glutamine level as a marker of overtraining has recently been highlighted, but a consensus has not yet been reached concerning the best method of determining the level. Since injury, infection, nutritional status and acute exercise can all influence plasma glutamine level, these factors must be controlled and/or taken into consideration if plasma glutamine is to prove a useful marker of impending overtraining.",

Falls in plasma glutamine concentration after exercise may have deleterious consequences for immune cell function and render the individual more susceptible to infection. The purpose of the present study was to examine changes in plasma glutamine concentration (measured using a validated enzymatic spectrophotometric method) following an acute bout of intermittent high-intensity exercise. Eight well-trained male games players took part in the study. Subjects reported to the laboratory following an overnight fast and performed a 1-h cycle exercise task consisting of 20 1-min periods at 100% maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) each separated by 2 min of recovery at 30% VO2max. Venous blood samples were taken before exercise and at 5 min, 1 h, 2.5 h, 5 h and 24 h post-exercise. Glutamine was measured by enzymatic spectrophotometric determination of the ammonia concentration before and after treatment of the plasma with glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2). Plasma glutamine concentration did not fall in the immediate post-exercise period [pre-exercise 681 (23) microM compared with 663 (46) microM at 5 min post-exercise, mean (SEM)], but fell to 572 (35) microM at 5 h post-exercise (P < 0.05 compared with pre-exercise). Plasma lactate concentration rose to 8.8 (1.0) mM at the end of exercise and fell to 1.8 (0.4) mM at 1 h post-exercise, but plasma concentrations of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate both rose substantially in the post-exercise period (to 240% and 400% of pre-exercise levels, respectively). The circulating leucocyte count increased significantly during exercise (P < 0.01), continued to increase in the hours following exercise and peaked at 2.5 h post-exercise (mainly due to a neutrophilia). The fall in the plasma glutamine concentration at 5 h post-exercise could be due to increased renal uptake of glutamine, which generally occurs in conditions of metabolic acidosis or due to a greater removal of glutamine from the plasma resulting from the elevated circulating leucocyte count.",

          "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence was conducted to obtain a conclusive result on the effects of glutamine supplementation on athletes. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data related to body mass, lean body mass, body fat percentage, Vo2 max, lymphocytes, leukocytes and neutrophil counts were extracted to determine the effects of GLN on performance outcomes. The literature search was conducted across the databases Pubmed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, SID (Scientific Information Database) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, covering a period up to January 2017. Clinical trials evaluating glutamine supplementation outcomes on athletes aged over 18 were included. A total of 47 studies were included in the systematic review, and 25 trials matched the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. According to the meta-analysis, glutamine has a significant effect on weight reduction (WMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.36 [95% CI:\u00a0-2.55 to\u00a0-0.16], p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Moreover, neutrophil numbers were reduced following glutamine intake at doses greater than 200\u00a0mg/kg body weight (WMD\u00a0=\u00a0-605.77 [95% CI:\u00a0-1200.0 to 52.1]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Also, supplementation by glutamine dipeptide resulted in higher blood glucose after exercise (WMD\u00a0=\u00a00.51 [95% CI: 0.18, 0.83] mmol/l; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). There was no association between glutamine ingestion and other outcomes investigated. According to this meta-analysis, generally, glutamine supplementation has no effect on athletics immune system, aerobic performance, and body composition. However, the current study showed that glutamine resulted in greater weight reduction. In addition, the present study suggests that the efficacy of glutamine supplementation on neutrophil numbers could be affected by supplement type and dose.",

Lymphocytes, (total, natural killer, and T), monocytes, and granulocytes did not change significantly in either group, at any time. Whole blood glutamine concentration decreased (p < 0.05) from 437 microM pre-exercise to 332 microM 3 d post-exercise in both groups. The decrease in glutamine suggests that the metabolism of the muscle may be affected by this exercise, however, the occurrence of this decrease in both groups suggests that this change was not a response to muscle damage.",

This study examined the possibility of abolishing the exercise-induced decrease in salivary IgA through glutamine supplementation during and after intense exercise. Eleven athletes performed cycle ergometer exercise for 2 h at 75% of maximal oxygen uptake on 3 separate days. Glutamine (a total of 17.5 g), protein (a total of 68.5 g/6.2 g protein-bound glutamine), and placebo supplements were given during and up to 2 h after exercise. Unstimulated, timed saliva samples were obtained before exercise and 20 min, 140 min, 4 h, and 22 h postexercise. The exercise protocol induced a decrease in salivary IgA (IgA concentration, IgA output, and IgA relative to total protein). The plasma concentration of glutamine was decreased by 15% 2 h postexercise in the placebo group, whereas this decline was abolished by both glutamine and protein supplements. None of the supplements, however, was able to abolish the decline in salivary IgA. This study does not support that postexercise decrease in salivary IgA is related to plasma glutamine concentrations.",

Resting plasma glutamine concentration was measured in five groups of eight distance runners, competitive swimmers, cyclists, powerlifters, and nonathletes. Dietary protein intake of each subject was measured (g.d-1 and g.kg-1.d-1). Plasma glutamine concentration was significantly different between sports (P = 0.000, ANOVA) with mean plasma glutamine concentration of cyclists significantly higher than in all other groups, and mean plasma glutamine concentration of powerlifters and swimmers significantly lower than in cyclists and nonathletes (P < 0.05, post hoc analysis). There was no significant relationship between plasma glutamine concentration and total dietary protein intake when expressed as g.d-1 (r = 0.11, P > 0.05); however, plasma glutamine concentration and dietary protein relative to body mass (g.kg-1.d-1) were significantly inversely correlated (r = -0.37, P = 0.007). These data suggest that resting plasma glutamine concentration may vary between sports, possibly due to metabolic demands of the different sports; dietary factors may also affect plasma glutamine concentration.",

The present study investigated whether L-glutamine (glutamine) decreases the severity of mucositis in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx induced by CRT. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial included 40 untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx. Patients received 66 or 70 Gy of total radiation at the rate of 2 Gy/fraction daily and 5 fractions/week. Cisplatin (20 mg/m2) and docetaxel (10 mg/m2) were intravenously co-administered once a week for 6 weeks. Patients were randomized to orally receive either glutamine (group G) or placebo (group P) at a dose of 10 g 3 times a day throughout the CRT course. Mucositis was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. The primary end point was mucositis severity. Mucositis developed in all patients. A maximal mucositis grade of G4 was observed in 0 and 25% group G and P patients, respectively, while that of G2 was observed in 10 and 0% group G and P patients, respectively (p=0.023). Glutamine significantly decreased the maximal mucositis grade (group G, 2.9\u00b10.3; group P, 3.3\u00b10.4; p=0.005) and pain score at weeks 4, 5 and 6.

          "content": "Leucine is a key amino acid involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis. We assessed the effect of the supplementation of a lower-protein mixed macronutrient beverage with varying doses of leucine or a mixture of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) on myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) at rest and after exercise. In a parallel group design, 40 men (21 \u00b1 1 y) completed unilateral knee-extensor resistance exercise before the ingestion of 25 g whey protein (W25) (3.0 g leucine), 6.25 g whey protein (W6) (0.75g leucine), 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine to 3.0 g total leucine (W6+Low-Leu), 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine to 5.0 g total leucine (W6+High-Leu), or 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine, isoleucine, and valine to 5.0 g total leucine. A primed continuous infusion of l-[ring-(13)C6] phenylalanine with serial muscle biopsies was used to measure MPS under baseline fasted and postprandial conditions in both a rested (response to feeding) and exercised (response to combined feeding and resistance exercise) leg. The area under the blood leucine curve was greatest for the W6+High-Leu group compared with the W6 and W6+Low-Leu groups (P < 0.001). In the postprandial period, rates of MPS were increased above baseline over 0-1.5 h in all treatments. Over 1.5-4.5 h, MPS remained increased above baseline after all treatments but was greatest after W25 (\u223c267%) and W6+High-Leu (\u223c220%) treatments (P = 0.002). A low-protein (6.25 g) mixed macronutrient beverage can be as effective as a high-protein dose (25 g) at stimulating increased MPS rates when supplemented with a high (5.0 g total leucine) amount of leucine. These results have important implications for formulations of protein beverages designed to enhance muscle anabolism. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 1530646.",

UK Biobank, a prospective study involving 22 recruitment centers across the United Kingdom. For this analysis, we included 266,840 participants from the UK Biobank who had available BCAA data and no history of MACE at baseline. Cox regression analysis was conducted to evaluate these associations, adjusting for potential confounders. During a 13.80 \u00b1 0.83-year follow-up, 52,598 participants experienced MACE, with the incidence of MACE increasing progressively across quintiles of circulating BCAAs, isoleucine, leucine, and valine. Overall, the fifth quintile exhibited a 7-12% higher MACE risk compared to the second quintile. In males, BCAAs were not associated with MACE risk. However, increased risks were observed for isoleucine (8-12% in higher quintiles), leucine (9% in the first quintile and 6% in the fifth quintile), and valine (8% in the first quintile). In females, higher quintiles of BCAAs, isoleucine, leucine, and valine were associated with increased MACE risk, ranging from 9% to 12%. Among participants under 65y, higher quintiles of BCAAs, isoleucine, and leucine were associated with increased MACE risk, while valine showed no significant association. No association was found in participants aged 65 and older. These analyses were adjusted for multiple potential confounders. Generally, higher levels of BCAAs, isoleucine, leucine, and valine were associated with an increased risk of MACE, except in participants older than 65. Additionally, in males, the lowest quintiles of leucine and valine were also associated with an increased risk of MACE.",

          "content": "Early prevention of sarcopenia could be an important strategy for muscle retention, but most studies have focused on subjects aged 65 or older. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of leucine-enriched protein supplementation on muscle condition in a sample including late middle-aged adults. A 12-week intervention was performed for 120 healthy community-dwelling adults by providing either leucine-enriched protein supplement [leucine 3 g, protein mixture (casein 50% + whey 40% + soy 10%) 17 g, vitamin D 800IU (20 \u00b5g), calcium 300 mg, fat 1.1 g, carbohydrate 2.5 g] or isocaloric carbohydrate supplement twice per day. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) and lean body mass (LBM) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A total of 111 participants completed the study, with a dropout rate of 9.2%. LBM normalized by height and body weight (LBM/Wt) was significantly increased ( < 0.001) in the intervention group (0 wk: 633.9 \u00b1 8.5 vs. 12 wk 636.9 \u00b1 8.4 in the intervention group; 0 wk: 638.6 \u00b1 8.3 vs. 12 wk: 632.9 \u00b1 8.1 in the control group). In subgroup analyses, significant differences remained only in subjects between 50 and 64 years of age. We concluded that leucine-enriched protein supplementation can have beneficial effects by preventing muscle loss, mainly for late middle-aged adults.",

          "content": "Protein intake is essential to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis, and the amino acid leucine seems to possess a superior effect on muscle protein synthesis compared to other amino acids. Native whey has higher leucine content and thus a potentially greater anabolic effect on muscle than regular whey (WPC-80). This study compared the acute anabolic effects of ingesting 2\u2009\u00d7\u200920 g of native whey protein, WPC-80 or milk protein after a resistance exercise session. 24 young resistance trained men and women took part in this double blind, randomized, partial crossover, controlled study. Participants received either WPC-80 and native whey (\u2009=\u200910), in a crossover design, or milk (\u2009=\u200912). Supplements were ingested immediately (20\u00a0g) and two hours after (20\u00a0g) a bout of heavy-load lower body resistance exercise. Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure plasma concentrations of amino acids by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry, muscle phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting, and mixed muscle protein synthesis by use of [H]phenylalanine-infusion, gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Being the main comparison, differences between native whey and WPC-80 were analysed by a one-way ANOVA and comparisons between the whey supplements and milk were analysed by a two-way ANOVA. Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 and milk (\u2009<\u20090.05). Native whey ingestion induced a greater phosphorylation of p70S6K than milk 180\u00a0min after exercise (\u2009=\u20090.03). Muscle protein synthesis rates increased 1-3\u00a0h hours after exercise with WPC-80 (0.119%), and 1-5\u00a0h after exercise with native whey (0.112%). Muscle protein synthesis rates were higher 1-5\u00a0h after exercise with native whey than with milk (0.112% vs. 0.064, \u2009=\u20090.023). Despite higher-magnitude increases in blood leucine concentrations with native whey, it was not superior to WPC-80 concerning effect on muscle protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70S6K during a 5-h post-exercise period. Native whey increased phosphorylation of p70S6K and muscle protein synthesis rates to a greater extent than milk during the 5-h post exercise period.

          "content": "The primary objective of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available literature relating to leucine supplementation in the elderly with respect to its effects on anthropometrical parameters and muscle strength. The secondary aim was to perform a selective subgroup analysis when possible differentiating between healthy and sarcopenic subjects. Literature search was performed using the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, SportDiscus, and the Cochrane Central Register of trials with restrictions to randomized controlled trials or studies following a cross-over design. Parameters taken into account were body weight, body mass index, lean body mass, fat mass, percentage of body fat, hand grip strength, and knee extension strength. Moreover, biomarkers of glucose metabolism (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, albumin, and HOMA index) were extracted when possible. For each outcome measure of interest, a meta-analysis was performed in order to determine the pooled effect of the intervention in terms of weighted mean differences between the post-intervention (or differences in means) values of the leucine and the respective control groups. Data analysis was performed using the Review Manager 5.2.4. software. A total of 16 studies enrolling 999 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Compared with control groups, leucine supplementation significantly increased gain in body weight [mean differences 1.02 kg, 95%-CI (0.19, 1.85), p=0.02], lean body mass [mean differences 0.99 kg, 95%-CI (0.43, 1.55), p=0.0005], and body mass index [mean differences 0.33 kg/m2, 95%-CI (0.13, 0.53), p=0.001], when compared to the respective control groups. With respect to body weight and lean body mass, leucine supplementation turned out to be more effective in the subgroup of study participants with manifested sarcopenia. All other parameters under investigation were not affected by leucine supplementation in a fashion significantly different from controls. It is concluded that leucine supplementation was found to exert beneficial effects on body weight, body mass index, and lean body mass in older persons in those subjects already prone to sarcopenia, but not muscle strength. However, due to the heterogeneity between the trials included in this systematic review, further studies adopting a homogenous design with respect to participant characteristics duration as well as the kind and amount of daily supplement in use are required.",

Demographic, lifestyle, and health data were obtained through interviews and questionnaires. The 24-h recall method was used to assess dietary intake. An amino acid database was established using the 9th revision of the Korean Standard Food Composition Table. The mean handgrip strength was estimated from triplicate measurements obtained using the dominant hand. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between BCAA intake and handgrip strength. Grains greatly contributed to amino acid intake; however, a significant negative association was observed between handgrip strength and increased BCAA intake through grains. In the fully adjusted model, leucine intake and handgrip strength showed a positive association. Thus, consuming BCAAs (especially leucine) via a variety of food sources can help maintain muscle health in older people.",

We measured the acute (hourly) and integrated (daily) myofibrillar protein synthesis (myoPS) response to consumption of a high-quality mixed protein beverage compared with an isonitrogenous protein beverage with added leucine. In a parallel design, free-living, healthy older women (aged 65-75 y, n = 11/group) consumed a fixed, weight-maintaining diet with protein at 1.0 g \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1 and were randomly assigned to twice-daily consumption of either 15 g milk protein beverage containing 4.2 g leucine (LEU) or 15 g mixed protein (milk and soy) beverage containing 1.3 g leucine (CON). Unilateral leg resistance exercise allowed a determination of acute ([13C6]-phenylalanine infusion, hourly rate) and integrated (deuterated water ingestion, daily rate) exercised and rested myoPS responses. Acute myoPS increased in response to feeding in the rested (CON: 13% \u00b1 4%; LEU: 53% \u00b1 5%) and exercised (CON: 30% \u00b1 4%; LEU: 87% \u00b1 7%) leg in both groups, but the increase was greater in LEU (P < 0.001). Integrated myoPS increased during the supplementation period in both legs (rested: 9% \u00b11%; exercised: 17% \u00b1 2%; P < 0.001) in LEU, but in the exercised leg only (7% \u00b1 2%; P < 0.001) in CON. A 15-g protein-containing beverage with \u223c4 g leucine induced greater increases in acute and integrated myoPS than did an isonitrogenous, isoenergetic mixed-protein beverage. Declines in muscle mass in older women may be attenuated with habitual twice-daily consumption of a protein beverage providing 15 g protein and higher (4.2 g/serving) amounts of leucine.

Outcomes investigated were: total body mass (TBM), FFM, fat mass (FM), total single repetition maximum (1RM), bench press (BP) 1RM, and lower body (LwB) 1RM. Databases consulted were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica database (Embase), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SportDiscus. Fourteen studies fit the inclusion criteria; however, 11 were analyzed after data extraction and funnel plot analysis exclusion. A total of 302 participants (18-45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 248 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes. We conclude that HMB produces a small effect on TBM gain, but this effect does not translate into significantly greater increases in FFM, strength or decreases in FM during periods of RET. Our findings do not support the use of HMB aiming at improvement of body composition or strength with RET.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of age on whole-body amino acid turnover in response to eccentric exercise and hyperglycemia-induced hyperinsulinemia. 16 healthy men were divided into young (N=8) and older (N=8) groups. Protein metabolism was assessed using a [1-13C]-leucine isotopic tracer approach. Measures were obtained under fasted basal conditions and during 3-h hyperglycemic clamps that were performed without (control) and 48 h after eccentric exercise. Exercise reduced leucine oxidation in the younger men (P<0.05), but not in older men. Insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated with leucine oxidation (P<0.05), and was lower in older men (P<0.05). Healthy aging is associated with an impaired capacity to adjust protein oxidation in response to eccentric exercise. The decreased efficiency of protein utilization in older men may contribute to impaired maintenance, growth, and repair of body tissues with advancing age.",

The branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine, abundant in whey, may mediate the glucoregulatory effects of whey. We investigated the comparative effects of intragastric administration of leucine, isoleucine and valine on the plasma glucose, C-peptide and glucagon responses to and gastric emptying of a mixed-nutrient drink in healthy men. (2) Methods: 15 healthy men (27 \u00b1 3 y) received, on four separate occasions, in double-blind, randomised fashion, either 10 g of leucine, 10 g of isoleucine, 10 g of valine or control, intragastrically, 30 min before a mixed-nutrient drink. Plasma glucose, C-peptide and glucagon concentrations were measured before, and for 2 h following, the drink. Gastric emptying of the drink was quantified using C-acetate breath-testing. (3) Results: Amino acids alone did not affect plasma glucose or C-peptide, while isoleucine and valine, but not leucine, stimulated glucagon ( < 0.05), compared with control. After the drink, isoleucine and leucine reduced peak plasma glucose compared with both control and valine (all  < 0.05). Neither amino acid affected early (t = 0-30 min) postprandial C-peptide or glucagon. While there was no effect on overall gastric emptying, plasma glucose at t = 30 min correlated with early gastric emptying ( < 0.05). (4) Conclusion: In healthy individuals, leucine and isoleucine lower postprandial blood glucose, at least in part by slowing gastric emptying, while valine does not appear to have an effect, possibly due to glucagon stimulation.",

This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse betaine supplementation's effects on exercise performance. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, focusing on studies comparing chronic betaine to a placebo in healthy humans aged 15-60\u2009years, measuring exercise outcomes. Studies with acute betaine supplementation, no control group, or animals were excluded. Quality assessment was done using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and a random-effects model was employed for the meta-analysis. The review included 17 studies with 317 participants (21% female). The results revealed a significant effect size of 0.47 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.89) for maximal strength (1RM, 3RM, maximal isokinetic or isometric force), particularly in the lower body (SMD: 0.49, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.98). No significant effects were found for upper body strength, cycling sprint power, bench press throws power, or muscular endurance. However, vertical jumping performance improved significantly (SMD: 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.69) after excluding a low-quality study. In conclusion, betaine supplementation for at least 7\u2009days significantly enhances muscular strength, especially lower body strength, and shows potential in improving vertical jumping performance.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effects of betaine supplementation on body composition indices (body mass (BM), BMI, body fat percentage (BFP), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM)), and dietary intakes. Studies examining the effects of betaine supplementation on body composition and dietary intakes published up to August 2021 were identified through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, SCOPUS and Ovid databases. Betaine supplementation failed to significantly affect BM ((weighted mean difference (WMD): -0\u00b740 kg, 95 % CI -1\u00b746, 0\u00b764),  = 0\u00b7447), BMI ((WMD: -0\u00b705 kg/m, 95 % CI -0\u00b736, 0\u00b725),  = 0\u00b7719), BFP ((WMD: 0\u00b726 %, 95 % CI -0\u00b782, 1\u00b736),  = 0\u00b7663), FM ((WMD: -0\u00b757 kg, 95 % CI -2\u00b714, 0\u00b799),  = 0\u00b7473) and FFM ((WMD: 0\u00b761 kg, 95 % CI -1\u00b727, 2\u00b749),  = 0\u00b7527).

We aim to investigate the association between serum choline and betaine levels with body composition in general population. This is an observational cross-sectional study performed in 1081 subjects from the CODING (Complex Disease in Newfoundland population: Environment and Genetics) study. Serum choline and betaine levels were measured based on liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry technology. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry following a 12-hour fast. Major confounding factors including age, sex, total calorie intake and physical activity level were controlled in all analyses. Significantly inverse correlations were found between serum betaine levels and all obesity measurements in males (r ranged from -0.12 to -0.23, and p<0.01 for all) but not in females. Serum choline was negatively associated with total percent body fat (%BF), percent trunk fat (%TF), weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (r ranged from -0.11 to -0.19, and p<0.05 for all) in males and positively associated with weight, BMI and WC (r ranged from 0.09 to 0.10, and p<0.05 for all) in females. The negative associations between serum choline and betaine levels with obesity in males were more profound in those not on any medication than those taking medications. Moreover, obese males had the lowest serum choline and betaine levels, followed by overweight males, and normal weight males having the highest serum choline and betaine levels, especially in those not taking medications (p<0.05). Likewise, subjects with the highest serum levels of both had the lowest obesity indexes, especially those not taking medications. Higher serum choline and betaine levels were associated with a more favorable body composition (lower body fat and higher lean body mass) in males and the favorable association was more pronounced in non-medication users.",

The registry included patients of all ages with homocystinuria who were treated with betaine anhydrous in conjunction with other therapies. Clinical data were collected retrospectively from 2007 to 2013, then prospectively up to February 2014. All adverse events (AEs) reported during the study were recorded. The clinical and biological status of patients was monitored at least once a year. A total of 125 patients with homocystinuria (adults [>\u200918\u2009years]: 50; paediatric [\u226418\u2009years]: 75) were enrolled at 29 centres in France and Spain. Patients were treated with betaine anhydrous for a mean duration of 7.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3\u2009years. The median total daily dose of betaine anhydrous at the first and last study visits was 6\u2009g/day for cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS)-deficient vitamin B6 responders and 9\u2009g/day for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase-deficient patients, while the median daily dose increased in CBS-deficient B6 non-responders (from 6 to 9\u2009g/day) and cobalamin metabolism-defective patients (from 3 to 6\u2009g/day) between the first and last visits. Treatment caused a mean overall reduction of 29% in plasma homocysteine levels in the study population. A total of 277 AEs were reported during the study, of which two non-serious AEs (bad taste and headache) and one serious AE (interstitial lung disease) were considered to be drug related. Overall, betaine anhydrous was well tolerated with no major safety concerns. Data from the RoCH registry provided real-world evidence on the clinical safety and efficacy of betaine anhydrous in the management of homocystinuria in paediatric and adult patients.",

          "content": "Betaine supplementation is used by athletes, but its mechanism of action is still not fully understood. We hypothesized that betaine supplementation would increase betaine concentration and alter amino acid profiles in relation to MTHFR genotype and dose in physically active males. The study followed a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design. Blood samples were collected before and after each supplementation period. Serum was analyzed for amino acid profile, homocysteine, betaine, choline, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) concentrations. For the washout analysis, only participants starting with betaine were included (n = 20). Statistical analysis revealed no differences in the amino acid profile after betaine supplementation. However, betaine concentration significantly increased after betaine supplementation (from 4.89 \u00b1 1.59 \u00b5g/mL to 17.31 \u00b1 9.21 \u00b5g/mL, P < .001), with a greater increase observed in MTHFR (C677T, rs180113) T-allele carriers compared to CC (P = .027). Betaine supplementation caused a decrease in homocysteine concentration (from 17.04 \u00b1 4.13 \u00b5mol/L to 15.44 \u00b1 3.48 \u00b5mol/L, P = .00005) and a non-significant increase in TMAO concentrations (from 0.27 \u00b1 0.20 \u00b5g/ml to 0.44 \u00b1 0.70 \u00b5g/ml, P = .053), but had no effect on choline concentrations. Serum betaine concentrations were not significantly different after the 21-day washout from the baseline values (baseline: 4.93 \u00b1 1.87 \u00b5g/mL and after washout: 4.70 \u00b1 1.70 \u00b5g/mL, P = 1.000). In conclusion, betaine supplementation increased betaine and decreased homocysteine concentrations, but did not affect the amino acid profile or choline concentrations in healthy active males.

We studied the associations between cognitive function and plasma concentrations of free choline and betaine.

Compared with low concentrations, high choline (>8\u00b74 \u03bcmol/l) was associated with better test scores in the TMT-A (56\u00b70 v. 61\u00b75, P=0\u00b7004), m-DST (10\u00b75 v. 9\u00b78, P=0\u00b7005) and m-MMSE (11\u00b75 v. 11\u00b74, P=0\u00b701). A generalised additive regression model showed a positive dose-response relationship between the m-MMSE and choline (P=0\u00b7012 from a corresponding linear regression model). Betaine was associated with the KOLT, TMT-A and COWAT, but after adjustments for potential confounders, the associations lost significance.

          "content": "Epidemiological studies have been inconsistent regarding the relations between diabetes risk and the consumption of eggs and nutrients in eggs, such as choline, betaine, and cholesterol. There have been few studies among elderly women. The objective of this study was to examine associations between consumption of eggs, cholesterol, choline, and betaine and the risk of diabetes among elderly US women. Multivariable Cox regression was used with data from the prospective Women's Health Initiative. Population attributable risks were calculated. Consumption of eggs alone (not mixed in foods) and nutrients were assessed with an FFQ. Diabetes incidence was defined as the first incidence of self-reported diabetes treated with oral diabetes medication or insulin injections. There were 46,263 women at follow-up baseline. During 13.3 y and 592,984 person-years of follow-up, there were 5480 incident diabetes cases. Higher egg, cholesterol, and choline consumption were each significantly associated with increases in diabetes risk. The associations for eggs and choline were not significant after adjustment for cholesterol consumption. The association for eggs was attenuated after adjustment for non-egg cholesterol consumption, with 1 significant HR in the top consumption quintile (\u22653 eggs/wk) of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.27; P for linear trend\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). The population attributable risks for obesity, overweight, consumption of \u22653 eggs/wk, inadequate exercise, and poor diet were 25.0 (95% CI: 22.3, 27.6), 12.8 (95% CI: 11.1, 14.5), 4.2 (95% CI: 2.3, 6.1), 3.5 (95% CI: 1.2, 5.8), and 3.1 (95% CI: 0.5, 5.7), respectively. As egg consumption increased to \u22653 eggs/wk, there was a steady increase in diabetes risk that may have been due to the cholesterol in the eggs. The population attributable risk for \u22653 eggs/wk was far lower than that for being obese or overweight.",

          "content": "Animal studies have suggested that betaine, but not choline, may improve body composition, but little evidence is available in humans. We examined the association of serum concentrations of choline and betaine with body composition and fat distribution in adults. This community-based study recruited 1996 adults (women/men: 1380/616) aged 40-75 years in urban Guangzhou, China. General information and anthropometric measurements were taken, and serum choline and betaine levels were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry between July 2008 and June 2010. After 3.2 years, 1623 of the 1996 participants were measured for fat mass (FM and %FM) over the total body (TB), trunk, limbs, android (A) and gynoid (G) regions. The %FM ratios of the A/G regions and the trunk and limbs were determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Univariate analyses showed that higher serum betaine levels were significantly associated with lower values of adiposity indices (all P-trends<0.05), except in the case of the %FM at the gynoid area. After adjusting for potential covariates, similar associations were observed. The mean percentage differences between quartiles 4 and 1 of the serum betaine levels were -4.9% (weight), -4.7% (body mass index, BMI), -2.5% (waist circumference), -7.9% (TB FM) and -3.4% (TB %FM). The mean differences in the FM and %FM were much more pronounced at the trunk (-10.0 and -4.5%) or android areas (-10.7 and -4.7%) than those at the limbs (-0.8 and -2.3%) or gynoid areas (-0.6 and -1.4%). Such favorable associations were stronger in men than in women. No significant associations between serum choline and the adiposity indices were observed, except in the cases of body weight and BMI. Greater circulating betaine, but not choline, was dose-dependently associated with better body composition and fat distribution due to a lower FM in the trunk regions in this population.",

Our aim is to investigate the associations of plasma TMAO, choline, L-carnitine and betaine with glomerular filtration in CKD patients. A total of 65 CKD patients and 64 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Fasting plasma metabolites were detected using liquid chromatography-based method. Plasma TMAO, choline, betaine and L-carnitine levels were differentially correlated with eGFR. The four metabolites were independently associated with CKD after adjustment for multiple traditional risk factors. The combination of the four metabolites had good performance at discriminating CKD from healthy controls (AUC\u2009=\u20090.96) as well as discriminating low eGFR from high eGFR in CKD (AUC\u2009=\u20090.96).

Choline is the precursor for betaine, but the effects of choline supplementation on plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations in healthy humans are unknown. The objective was to investigate whether supplementation with phosphatidylcholine, the form in which choline occurs in foods, reduces fasting and postmethionine-loading concentrations of plasma tHcy in healthy men with mildly elevated plasma tHcy concentrations. In a crossover study, 26 men ingested approximately 2.6 g choline/d (as phosphatidylcholine) or a placebo oil mixture for 2 wk in random order. Fatty acid composition and fat content were similar for both treatments. A methionine-loading test was performed on the first and last days of each supplementation period. Phosphatidylcholine supplementation for 2 wk decreased mean fasting plasma tHcy by 18% (-3.0 micromol/L; 95% CI: -3.9, -2.1 micromol/L). On the first day of supplementation, a single dose of phosphatidylcholine containing 1.5 g choline reduced the postmethionine-loading increase in tHcy by 15% (-4.8 micromol/L; 95% CI: -6.8, -2.8 micromol/L). Phosphatidylcholine supplementation for 2 wk reduced the postmethionine-loading increase in tHcy by 29% (-9.2 micromol/L; 95% CI: -11.3, -7.2 micromol/L). All changes were relative to placebo. A high daily dose of choline, supplemented as phosphatidylcholine, lowers fasting as well as postmethionine-loading plasma tHcy concentrations in healthy men with mildly elevated tHcy concentrations.

This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of betaine supplementation on cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers. Studies examining betaine supplementation on CVD markers published up to February 2021 were identified through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and SCOPUS. Betaine supplementation had a significant effect on concentrations of betaine (MD: 82.14\u2009\u03bcmol/L, 95% CI: 67.09 to 97.20), total cholesterol (TC) (MD: 14.12\u2009mg/dl, 95% CI%: 9.23 to 19.02), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (MD: 10.26\u2009mg/dl, 95% CI: 6.14 to 14.38)], homocysteine (WMD: -1.30 micromol/L, 95% CI: -1.61 to -0.98), dimethylglycine (DMG) (MD: 21.33 micromol/L, 95% CI: 13.87 to 28.80), and methionine (MD: 2.06 micromol/L, 95% CI: 0.23 to 3.88). Moreover, our analysis indicated that betaine supplementation did not affect serum concentrations of triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood glucose (FBG), C-reactive protein (CRP), liver enzymes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)], and blood pressure. Our subgroup analysis suggested that a maximum dose of 4\u2009g/d might have homocysteine-lowering effects without any adverse effect on lipid profiles reported with doses of \u22654\u2009g/d. In conclusion, the present systematic review and meta-analysis supports the advantage of a lower dose of betaine supplementation (<4\u2009g/d) on homocysteine concentrations without the lipid-augmenting effect observed with a higher dosage.",

          "content": "Choline and betaine have been suggested to play a pivotal role in neurotransmitter synthesis, cell membrane integrity, and methyl-group metabolism, exerting neuroprotective effects in patients with various neurological disorders. However, population-based evidence on choline and betaine with subsequent cardiovascular events after stroke is rare. We aimed to prospectively investigate the relationships of circulating choline and betaine with cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic stroke. We performed a nested case-control study within the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke. A total of 323 cardiovascular events (including 264 recurrent strokes) and 323 controls (free of recurrent cardiovascular events) matched for age (\u00b11 y), sex, and treatment group were included. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events after ischemic stroke. Plasma choline and betaine were measured at baseline by ultra-high-performance LC-MS/MS. Conditional logistic regression models were applied, and discrimination, reclassification, and calibration of models with choline pathway metabolites were evaluated. Plasma choline and betaine were inversely associated with cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke after ischemic stroke. Specifically, in fully adjusted models, each additional SD of choline and betaine was associated with 35% (95% CI: 20%-48%) and 30% (95% CI: 14%-43%) decreased risks of subsequent cardiovascular events, respectively, and 34% (95% CI: 16%-48%) and 29% (95% CI: 12%-43%) decreased risks of recurrent stroke, respectively. In addition, both choline and betaine offered substantial risk discrimination and reclassification improvement for cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke beyond traditional risk factors, as evidenced by an increase in C statistics, the net reclassification index, and integrated discrimination improvement. Plasma choline pathway metabolites, including choline and betaine, were associated with decreased risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke and provided incremental value in risk discrimination and stratification in patients with ischemic stroke. This nested case-control study was based on the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke, which is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01840072.",

          "content": "The goal of the present study was to determine whether an acute dose of a zinc-containing nutritional supplement (ZMA) has any effects on sleep and morning performance in recreationally trained males. Nineteen males participated in a repeated-measures within-subjects study to assess objective and subjective measures of sleep, completed counter-movement jumps (CMJ) and repeated sprint morning performance (RSP). Three days of baseline food intake showed no major deficiencies of zinc, magnesium or vitamin B6 for all participants (11.9 \u00b1 3.4, 395 \u00b1 103 and 2.7 \u00b1 0.9 mg.day, respectively). Sleep (22:30-06:30 h) was assessed via actimetry, and either a control (no tablets, NoPill), dextrose placebo (PLAC) or ZMA was ingested 30-60 min before retiring to bed for two nights. The participants undertook the three conditions (NoPill, PLAC or ZMA) administered in a counterbalanced order. The data were analyzed using general linear models with repeated measures. In healthy active males who consume diets of adequate micronutrients, sleep normally and maintain good sleep hygiene (time to bed and wake times), ZMA supplementation had no beneficial effect on RSP or performance in the Stroop test ( > 0.05) but did improve CMJ height ( < 0.001) compared to that of PLAC but not NoPill ( > 0.05). Supplementation of ZMA for two nights had no effect on sleep, RSP or cognitive function. The NoPill condition elucidated the effects of the intervention under investigation.",

Average power (AP), average velocity (AV), peak velocity (PV), displacement (D) and time-to-peak velocity (tPV) were recorded using MuscleLab linear encoders. Data were analysed using a general linear model with repeated measures and linear correlation.  No significant main effect for condition was found for performance values or subjective ratings of fatigue. Main effect for \"load\" on the bar was found, where AP and tPV values increased with load ( < 0.05). No significant relationship between dose of zinc or magnesium ingested and change in performance for 80% 1 RM power-outputs was found.

The aim of this study was to examine whether  L. supplementation can attenuate oxidative stress and inflammatory responses to acute aerobic exercise and improve DOMS. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design study, thirteen healthy men received either a daily supplement of  L. or a placebo for 4\u2009weeks (2-week wash-out period between trials). Before and after the supplementation periods, participants performed an exercise test to exhaustion (75% VOmax). DOMS, thigh girth, and knee joint range of motion (KJRM) were assessed before and after the exercise (2, 24, and 48\u2009h). Blood samples were analyzed for reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, GSH/GSSG ratio, protein carbonyls, total antioxidant capacity, creatine kinase activity, white blood cell count, and TBARS. Acute exercise to exhaustion induced inflammatory responses and changed the blood redox status in both Tribulus and Placebo groups (\u2009<\u20090.050).  L. improved GSH fall (\u2009=\u20090.005), GSSG rise (\u2009=\u20090.001) and maintained a higher level of GSH/GSSG ratio at the 2\u2009h point (\u2009=\u20090.034). TBARS were lowered, protein carbonyls, creatine kinase activity, and white blood cell count elevation diminished significantly (\u2009<\u20090.050).  L. administration did not affect DOMS, thigh girth, or KJRM (\u2009>\u20090.050). 4-weeks of  L. supplementation effectively attenuates oxidative stress responses but cannot improve DOMS.",

(TT) ingredients have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, but their effects on exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) in trained athletes are uncertain. The purpose of this single-blind placebo-controlled trial, in accordance with CONSORT guidelines, was to examine the effect of 6 weeks of TT supplementation on muscle metabolism, inflammation biomarkers, and oxidant status. Thirty trained male CrossFit\u00ae athletes were randomly assigned to be supplemented with 770 mg/day of TT (intervention group (IG)) or receive a placebo daily (control group (CG)) for 6 weeks. Muscle damage enzymes, inflammation biomarkers, and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) were assessed at baseline (T1), 21 days after baseline (T2), and after 42 days (T3). Grace, a Workout of the Day, was measured in T1 and T3. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was found between IG and CG in Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and TAS levels at the end of the follow-up. Furthermore, TAS levels were significantly (p < 0.05) lower at T2 and T3 relative to baseline in the IG, also LDH and CRP increased significantly (p < 0.05) at T2 and T3 relative to baseline in the CG. No significant (p > 0.05) decreases in muscle damage or inflammation biomarkers were observed, although a slight downward trend was observed after 6 weeks for supplemented athletes. TT supplementation could attenuate the CrossFit\u00ae training program-induced oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inflammation which could be due to the natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of TT.",

In total, 37 ingredients were identified and PUBMED online database was reviewed for randomized-controlled trials (RCT) studying their efficacy. Ingredients were categorized based on evidence quantity using an adapted version of the American Heart Association scoring system. In total, 16 ingredients from testosterone supplements and 21 from ED supplements were identified. Tribulus, Eurycoma longifolia, Zinc, L-arginine, Aspartate, Horny goat weed, and Yohimbine were most common. In all, 105 RCTs studying the identified ingredients were found. No whole supplement products have published RCT evidence. 19% of ingredients received an A grade for strong positive evidence with net positive evidence in two or more RCTs. In total, 68% received C or D grades for contradicting, negative, or lacking evidence. Overall, 69% of ingredients in testosterone supplements and 52% of ingredients in ED supplements have published RCT evidence.

          "content": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common condition that significantly affects quality of life and interpersonal relationships. Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of herbal dietary supplements in the treatment of ED. We searched five databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the clinical efficacy of herbal medicines in ED. Quality was assessed and risk of bias was estimated using the Jadad score and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. In total, 24 RCTs, including 2080 patients with ED, were identified. Among these, 12 evaluated monopreparations (five ginseng [n\u2009=\u2009399], three saffron [n\u2009=\u2009397], two Tribulus terrestris [n\u2009=\u2009202], and one each Pinus pinaster [n\u2009=\u200921] and Lepidium meyenii [n\u2009=\u200950]), seven evaluated formulations (n\u2009=\u2009544), and five investigated dietary supplements in combination with pure compounds (n\u2009=\u2009410). Ginseng significantly improved erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF]-5 score: 140 ginseng, 96 placebo; standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.70; P\u2009<\u20090.01; I\u2009=\u20090), P. pinaster and L. meyenii showed very preliminary positive results, and saffron and T. terrestris treatment produced mixed results. Several herbal formulations were associated with a decrease of IIEF-5 or IIEF-15, although the results were preliminary. The quality of the included studies varied, with only seven having a prevalent low risk of bias. The median methodological quality Jadad score was three out of a maximum of five. Adverse events were recorded in 19 of 24 trials, with no significant differences between placebo and verum in placebo-controlled studies. Encouraging evidence suggests that ginseng may be an effective herbal treatment for ED. However, further, larger, and high-quality studies are required before firm conclusions can be drawn. Promising (although very preliminary) results have also been generated for some herbal formulations. Overall, more research in the field, adhering to the CONSORT statement extension for reporting trials, is justified before the use of herbal products in ED can be recommended.",

          "content": "The use of nutraceutical products to enhance male sexual performance has a long history, especially with regard to the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Alternative treatments for ED are becoming increasingly popular, with growing interest from consumers, as well as increased revenue for manufacturers. Dietary supplements (DSs), which are a mixture of active ingredients, are mainly sold online. In randomized controlled trials, the molecules contained in DSs have demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness, or even have no evidence to support their use. However, none of the studies carried out provided sufficient evidence to consider these products a first-line therapy. Therefore, the combination of the various active ingredients, especially in relation to the daily dose, leaves doubts about the real effectiveness. In order to evaluate the potential efficacy of DS formulations, we analyzed the products marketed in Italy using a scoring approach. A systematic review of the literature was performed to evaluate the effect of DS and to detect the active ingredients able to improve erectile function-called effective ingredients (EIs)-and their minimal effective daily dose (mED). A metanalysis identified some nutraceuticals, such as Panax ginseng, Tribulus terrestris and L-arginine, that are able to improve male sexual function. Based on the scoring system, 2 (8%) supplements matched with the cluster of higher expected efficacy, 3 (12%) with the lower efficacy cluster and 20 (80%) matched with the criterion of no expected efficacy. DSs marketed in Italy are usually blends of many substances that are frequently employed at a negligible dose or without any evidence.",

          "content": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Tribulus terrestris for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women and evaluate its effect on the serum levels of testosterone. We performed a prospective randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, during 18 months. A total of 45 healthy sexually active postmenopausal women reporting diminished libido were selected to participate in the study and were randomly assigned to receive 750\u200amg/d of T terrestris or placebo for 120 days. Randomization was performed using sealed envelopes. All participants answered the Female Sexual Function Index and the Sexual Quotient-female version questionnaires and had their serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, total testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin measured. A total of 36 participants completed the study, because 3 from each group were excluded due to side effects and 3 dropped out due to personal reasons. FSFI questionnaire results demonstrated an improvement in all domains in both groups (P\u200a<\u200a0.05) except for lubrication which was improved only in the study group. QS-F results showed a significant improvement in the domains of desire (P\u200a<\u200a0.01), arousal/lubrication (P\u200a=\u200a0.02), pain (P\u200a=\u200a0.02), and anorgasmia (P\u200a<\u200a0.01) in women who used T terrestris, whereas no improvement was observed in the placebo group (P\u200a>\u200a0.05). Moreover, free and bioavailable testosterone levels showed a significant increase in the T terrestris group (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). Tribulus terrestris might be a safe alternative for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women, because it was effective in reducing symptoms with few side effects. Its probable mechanism of action involves an increase in the serum levels of free and bioavailable testosterone.",

Subjects performed 3 days of resistance training per week for 8 weeks. Each day during Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, subjects consumed either placebo (PL; n = 10) or a supplement (ANDRO-6; n = 10), which contained daily doses of 300 mg androstenedione, 150 mg DHEA, 750 mg Tribulus terrestris, 625 mg Chrysin, 300 mg Indole-3-carbinol, and 540 mg Saw palmetto. Serum androstenedione concentrations were higher in ANDRO-6 after 2, 5, and 8 weeks (p <.05), while serum concentrations of free and total testosterone were unchanged in both groups. Serum estradiol was elevated at Weeks 2, 5, and 8 in ANDRO-6 (p <.05), and serum estrone was elevated at Weeks 5 and 8 (p <.05). Muscle strength increased (p <.05) similarly from Weeks 0 to 4, and again from Weeks 4 to 8 in both treatment groups. The acute effect of one third of the daily dose of ANDRO-6 and PL was studied in 10 men (23 +/- 4 years). Serum androstenedione concentrations were elevated (p <.05) in ANDRO-6 from 150 to 360 min after ingestion, while serum free or total testosterone concentrations were unchanged. These data provide evidence that the addition of these herbal extracts to androstenedione does not result in increased serum testosterone concentrations, reduce the estrogenic effect of androstenedione, and does not augment the adaptations to resistance training.",

We performed unrestricted electronic searches in the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, WHO-ICTR, Clinicaltrials.gov and OpenGrey databases. We included any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared  versus inactive/active interventions. After the selection process, conducted by two reviewers, 5 RCTs (\u2009=\u2009279 participants) were included. Data extraction was performed by two reviewers with a preestablished data collection formulary. Due to lack of data and clinical heterogeneity, we could not perform meta-analyses. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool, and the certainty of evidence was assessed with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). After 1 to 3 months of treatment, premenopausal and postmenopausal women randomized to  had a significant increase in sexual function scores. Three months of treatment with  showed a significant increase in the serum testosterone levels of premenopausal women. There was no report of serious adverse events, and none of the studies assessed health-related quality of life. The certainty of the evidence was very low, which means that we have very little confidence in the effect estimates, and future studies are likely to change these estimates.

          "content": "The aim of the current study is to investigate the influence of Tribulus terrestris extract on androgen metabolism in young males. Twenty-one healthy young 20-36 years old men with body weight ranging from 60 to 125 kg were randomly separated into three groups-two experimental (each n=7) and a control (placebo) one (n=7). The experimental groups were named TT1 and TT2 and the subjects were assigned to consume 20 and 10 mg/kg body weight per day of Tribulus terrestris extract, respectively, separated into three daily intakes for 4 weeks. Testosterone, androstenedione and luteinizing hormone levels in the serum were measured 24 h before supplementation (clear probe), and at 24, 72, 240, 408 and 576 h from the beginning of the supplementation. There was no significant difference between Tribulus terrestris supplemented groups and controls in the serum testosterone (TT1 (mean+/-S.D.: 15.75+/-1.75 nmol/l); TT2 (mean+/-S.D.: 16.32+/-1.57 nmol/l); controls (mean+/-S.D.: 17.74+/-1.09 nmol/l) (p>0.05)), androstenedione (TT1 (mean+/-S.D.: 1.927+/-0.126 ng/ml); TT2 (mean+/-S.D.: 2.026+/-0.256 ng/ml); controls (mean+/-S.D.: 1.952+/-0.236 ng/ml) (p>0.05)) or luteinizing hormone (TT1 (mean+/-S.D.: 4.662+/-0.274U/l); TT2 (mean+/-S.D.: 4.103+/-0.869U/l); controls (mean+/-S.D.: 4.170+/-0.406U/l) (p>0.05)) levels. All results were within the normal range. The findings in the current study anticipate that Tribulus terrestris steroid saponins possess neither direct nor indirect androgen-increasing properties.

Professional sportsmen and amateurs alike are in a constant search for new means that will enable them better sport results in shorter time. Among those means, a prominent place belongs to dietary supplements. However, the producers often advertise products whose use in sports is neither scientifically founded nor safe. This brings on an irrational use of herbal supplements which sometimes leads to unwanted side effects, but is more often of little use. Thus, the aim of this review will be to systematically evaluate some of the herbal supplements that are used as adaptogenic and ergogenic aids in sport. The review will include available data on Rhodiola rosea, Withania somnifera, Schisandra chinensis, Tribulus terrestris, Vitis vinifera, Citrus aurantium, and others.

The degree of tissue damage was assessed by measuring creatine kinase (CK) and C-reactive protein levels (CRP) preoperatively and 2 hours, 1 day, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks postoperatively. Generalized linear mixed models analyses were used to assess differences between serum markers over time; correction for possible confounding factors was performed. The Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and the Harris Hip Score were assessed preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively. There were no differences in patient demographics. The DAA had a longer operative time (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). CK and CRP levels increased postoperatively, but no significant differences between the groups were found on any of the time points. Functional outcomes were also similar in both approaches. No difference in tissue damage measured with serum markers CK and CRP were found between the DAA and PLA for total hip arthroplasty.",

Sixteen male boxers participated; they were randomly assigned to an experimental group (DAA) or a control group (C) and underwent 14 days of supplementation, 6 g/day of DAA. Both DAA and C participants were exposed to normobaric hypoxia (FiO = 15.5%; 2500 m) for 10-12 h a day over a period of 11 days.

          "content": "The prediction of the chronological age of a deceased individual at time of death can provide important information in case of unidentified bodies. The methodological possibilities in these cases depend on the availability of tissues, whereby bones are preserved for a long time due to their mineralization under normal environmental conditions. Age-dependent changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) as well as the accumulation of pentosidine (Pen) and D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) could be useful molecular markers for age prediction. A combination of such molecular clocks into one age prediction model seems favorable to minimize inter- and intra-individual variation. We therefore developed (I) age prediction models based on the three molecular clocks, (II) examined the improvement of age prediction by combination, and (III) investigated if samples with signs of decomposition can also be examined using these three molecular clocks. Skull bone from deceased individuals was collected to obtain a training dataset (n\u2009=\u200986), and two independent test sets (without signs of decomposition: n\u2009=\u200944, with signs of decomposition: n\u2009=\u200948). DNAm of 6 CpG sites in ELOVL2, KLF14, PDE4C, RPA2, TRIM59 and ZYG11A was analyzed using massive parallel sequencing (MPS). The D-Asp and Pen contents were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Age prediction models based on ridge regression were developed resulting in mean absolute errors (MAEs)/root mean square errors (RMSE) of 5.5years /6.6 years (DNAm), 7.7 years /9.3 years (Pen) and 11.7 years /14.6 years (D-Asp) in the test set. Unsurprisingly, a general lower accuracy for the DNAm, D-Asp, and Pen models was observed in samples from decomposed bodies (MAE: 7.4-11.8 years, RMSE: 10.4-15.4 years). This reduced accuracy could be caused by multiple factors with different impact on each molecular clock. To acknowledge general changes due to decomposition, a pilot model for a possible age prediction based on the decomposed samples as training set improved the accuracy evaluated by leave-one-out-cross validation (MAE: 6.6-12 years, RMSE: 8.1-15.9 years). The combination of all three molecular age clocks did reveal comparable MAE and RMSE results to the pure analysis of the DNA methylation for the test set without signs of decomposition. However, an improvement by the combination of all three clocks was possible for the decomposed samples, reducing especially the deviation in case of outliers in samples with very high decomposition and low DNA content. The results demonstrate the general potential in a combined analysis of different molecular clocks in specific cases.",
