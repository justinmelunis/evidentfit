Monthly quality filtering using hard-coded thresholds.

Evaluates each paper against each supplement tag independently:
- Uses hard-coded quality thresholds (from bootstrap corpus analysis)
- Includes top N most recent papers per supplement (recency guarantee)
- Multi-supplement papers evaluated per-tag (use lowest threshold)
- Filters supplement tags based on which ones qualify
